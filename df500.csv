a_lost_wand,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Lost_Wand,A Lost Wand,"""A Lost Wand"" is a fairy tale written by Jean Ingelow. It was first published in 1872 as part of The Little Wonder Horn, and later republished as one of the stories in Wonder-Box Tales in 1902. The story revolves around Hulda, a lucky young girl in Norway who receives the opportunity to be granted a wish after finding a ring in her slice of cake.

","After finding a magical ring in her slice of cake, Hulda is given the opportunity to make a wish. A fairy appears from the flower on top of the cake, and tells Hulda she will give her anything she wishes for. Unknowing of what her wish would bring, she asks for the fairy's wand. After handing Hulda her beautiful gold wand, the fairy is stripped of her powers and will ultimately be held at the will of her enemy if she doesn’t one day retrieve the wand. It could not be returned immediately, it had to be on a midsummers day. Until then, the fairy requested that Hulda keep it safe for her while she was gone. Days passed and the fairy had never returned, this left Hulda believing that the fairy had died. Then a dishonest guest paid a visit to Hulda and convinced her to trade the wand for a piece of his beautiful jewelry. After trading the wand for a bracelet with a bird clasp, Hulda realizes her visitor was actually a gnome. The gnome was the enemy the fairy had been worried about; with the wand in his possession he would make the fairy his slave. Hulda was aware she made a mistake, and did not rest until she retrieved the gold wand and returned it to the fairy. Not only did she give the fairy her powers back, but also in turn she saved her own life."

The tale portion of it is subordinate to the riddle, and the tale is not widely found in the oral tradition.","Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband, “If thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee.” And he did so. Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference? Answer: as she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her."

","A young and handsome king, whenever he could leave his duties, liked to wander the world.  He passed by the castle of an emperor and heard his three daughters speak.  They all wished they could marry him; the oldest said that she would keep his house clean; the second, that she would make his house like two golden apples; the third, that she would bear him golden twins.  He married the third, and she became pregnant, but his old favorite, a gypsy slave, envied the queen.  When the children were due, the king had to go to war.  He was greeted back with two puppies, which he was told the queen had borne.  He made the queen a slave, and the gypsy girl his queen.
In reality, the queen had borne two golden babies, but the gypsy girl had killed them and buried them in the vineyard.  Two firs grew from their graves. At night, they turned into children again and went to nurse from their mother, which consoled her.  The king liked the trees but the gypsy hated them, and she made him cut them down.  The king had two beds made from them.  In the night, the beds talked to each other; the one carrying the gypsy did not like it, but the one carrying their father liked it better.  The gypsy girl heard it and had them burned.  Two sparks flew into bran that an ewe had ate, and the ewe gave birth to two lambs with golden fleeces.  The king saw these lambs and loved them.  The gypsy girl had them killed and assigned the queen the task of washing out their entrails.
A crow caught some of the entrails and would not give it back without some cornmeal; the miller would not give her cornmeal without a chicken; a hen would not give her chick without corn; but a kind farmer gave her corn, the hen then gave her a chick, the miller then gave her cornmeal, and the crow then gave her back the piece – but more had washed away while she did this, and she could not retrieve it.
The entrails caught on a snag, and when the waters retreated, they became a girl and a boy.  The boy cut down osiers with his hatchet and the girl spun on her distaff, and people came to look at their beauty.  The king was so delighted that he took them home, and the gypsy girl did not dare do anything to them.  One day she broke her pearl necklace and it could not be rethreaded; the pearls escaped everyone's fingers.  The king asked the children to do it, and they could.  While they did it, the boy told the king the story of their lives (with a refrain of ""o, a string of pearls twined with golden flowers"").  The king had the gypsy girl stoned to death and restored his queen."
a_tale_of_the_tontlawald,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_the_Tontlawald,A Tale of the Tontlawald,"A Tale Of The Tontlawald (Estonian: Tontla mets) is an Estonian fairy tale collected by Dr. Friedrich Kreutzwald in Eestirahwa Ennemuistesed jutud.   W. F. Kirby included it, as ""The Wood of Tontla"" in The Hero of Esthonia.  Andrew Lang included it in The Violet Fairy Book; he listed his source as Ehstnische Märchen, which was the German translation of Kreutzwald's work, by F. Löwe.

","No one ventured to Tontlawald.  The King of Sweden had ordered the woods chopped down, but no one dared. 
Some bold souls had ventured into Tontlawald, and reported seeing a ruined house surrounded by beings that looked like men, women, and children.  One night a peasant who had wandered farther than most came back with the same tale, adding that an old crone stirred the fire now and again, which sent the children away, shrieking, and an old man had carried a sack into the woods, with women and children weeping and trying to pull down the sack, and a black cat as big as a foal.  No one believed him.
A peasant had remarried, and he and his new wife quarreled, and she abused her stepdaughter Elsa.  One day, the children were gathering strawberries when a boy realized they were in the Tontlawald; the rest ran off, but Elsa did not think the woods could be worse than her stepmother.  She met a little black dog with a silver collar, and a maiden dressed in silk who asked her to stay and be her friend.  The maiden brought Elsa back to her mother, who initially resisted allowing Elsa to stay but finally agreed.  The maiden took Elsa to the sea and they played there, and came back in the evening.  That evening, a man made a copy of Elsa and sent the copy back to the village in her place.  Elsa stayed many years and learned many marvels, and grew up as the maiden did not.
Finally, however, the lady there said that Elsa must leave because she had grown up.
Back in the village, the stepmother had beaten the figure until one day a venomous snake came out of its mouth and killed her.  Her husband found her, and then that night ate a piece of bread.  In the morning, he was as dead as his wife, because it had been in the figure.
The lady turned Elsa into a bird, and she flew home.  There, a prince shot her while she was in her bird form.  When she fell to the ground, she reassumed her human form.  The prince took her home and married her, and in time, she became queen.
No one ever heard of the Tontlawald after that."
one_thousand_and_one_nights,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_the_Fisherman_and_Abdullah_the_Merman,One Thousand and One Nights,"One Thousand and One Nights (Arabic: أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌ, ʾAlf Laylah wa-Laylah) is a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition (c. 1706–1721), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' Entertainment.The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central and South Asia, and North Africa. Some tales trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Egyptian, Sanskrit, Persian, and Mesopotamian literature. Many tales were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras, while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hezār Afsān (Persian: هزار افسان, lit. A Thousand Tales), which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.Common to all the editions of the Nights is the framing device of the story of the ruler Shahryār being narrated the tales by his wife Scheherazade. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while some are self-contained. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.
Some of the stories commonly associated with the Arabian Nights—particularly ""Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp"" and ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves""—were not part of the collection in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by Antoine Galland after he heard them from the Syrian Maronite Christian storyteller Hanna Diab on Diab's visit to Paris. Other stories, such as ""The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor"", had an independent existence before being added to the collection.","The main frame story concerns Shahryār whom the narrator calls a ""Sasanian king"" ruling in ""India and China."" Shahryār is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful. Discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him.
Eventually the Vizier (Wazir), whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.
The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of erotica. Numerous stories depict jinn, ghouls, ape people, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.
Versions differ, at least in detail, as to final endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.
The narrator's standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing their life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen—and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life."

The tale was also published by Irish poet Alfred Perceval Graves in his Irish Fairy Book (1909). Joseph Jacobs published the tale as The Lad with the Goat-Skin in his Celtic Fairy Tales.The tale is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 650A, ""Strong John"".

","In Enniscorthy, a woman is so poor that she gives her son (an ash-lad), who lives around the hearth, a goat-skin to wrap around the waist. When he is ""six foot high"" and nineteen years old, his mother sends him to the forest to fetch some ""bresna"". He finds a nine-foot-high giant in the woods and spares his life, gaining a club from the giant. When sent again, he meets a two-headed giant who gives Tom (Gilla's name) a magical fife that makes people dance, and a three headed giant who gives him a ""green ointment"" that grants immunity against burns, wounds and scalding.
Later, he walks down the road and reaches a city. There he learns that the King of Dublin's daughter hasn't laughed in seven years, and intends to make her laugh three times. The second time, Tom uses the magical fife to command a terrible wolf to dance. On that same night, the king tells Tom he needs a powerful flail to vanquish the Danes. So Tom ""travelled and travelled till he came in sight of the walls of hell"" and talked to the devils to loan the flail.
His rival at court, a fellow named Redhead, tries to wield the flail and fails, which creates a scene so comical that the princess bursts out laughing. The princess accepts Tom as his husband. The Danes, eventually, give up their plans of invading Dublin, so frightened they were of rumors of the flail."

The tale is related to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband, and shares motifs with other tales of the region, like Hungarian The Serpent Prince and Romanian Trandafiru.

","A childless queen prays to God for a child, even if it is a snake. God answers her prayers and a snake child is born. They raise the child for years and finally the snake talks to its parents: he wants a bride. His parents arrange a marriage for him with a peasant girl and they marry. Some time later, the girl appears pregnant and the queen questions how that is possible if her son is a snake. The girl reveals her husband takes off the snake skin at night and becomes a handsome man. The queen delights at this information and tells her daughter-in-law she should burn the snakeskin to keep him in human form for good.
That night, the girl does as asked. Her husband awakes and curses his wife to walk with iron shoes and to not give birth until she finds him again and he places his right arm over her body, and vanishes. The girl goes after him and passes by the Mother of the Sun (who gives her a golden distaff with golden flax and a golden spindle), the Mother of the Moon (who gives her a golden hen with golden chicks) and the Mother of the Winds (who gives her a golden loom with golden yarn). The Wind directs her to another kingdom, where her husband has married another empress.
She walks a bit more and reaches the kingdom. She positions herself by the Empress's castle doors, and takes out the golden object she received to draw the Empress's attention. She trades the objects for three nights with her husband: on the first two, he does not respond to her plea, because he has drunk a sleeping potion, but on the third night, he listens to her plight and touches her belly. Their child is born (a golden-haired, golden-armed boy), and they return home."

To pretend to learn where it is, he reads a book, and she gives him two piastres.  He decides to become a seer.

In his compilation Le Cabinet des Fées (tome 31), Charles-Joseph de Mayer stated that the author was unknown, but it was finally attributed to the Chevalier de Mailly (1657–1724). Andrew Lang collected it in The Yellow Fairy Book.

","A king's wife dies in childbirth, leaving a boy heir. The godmother, the ""Good Queen"", names the boy Alphege and keeps an eye on him from afar. Alphege is brought up by a lady courtier and her husband, who also have daughter, Zayda.  The king eventually remarries and has another son; the new queen becomes jealous that Alphege, and not her own son, will become king and seeks help from her friend the ""Fairy of the Mountain"". The Good Queen sends Alphege a talisman, a red ruby, which will protect him only within his father's realm. The wicked queen fruitlessly plots to get Alphege out of the country, until chance intervenes and he is sent to visit the king's sister. On the way, the entourage stops by a brook, where Alphege drinks the water and immediately rushes off and disappears. Searchers are told by a mysterious black monkey that he will not return until after they have failed for some time to recognise him. The entourage returns; the king dies in his grief and the wicked queen's son becomes king.
Years later, the king is out hunting and spies a green monkey looking at him strangely; he entices it to eat and takes it back to the palace. Soon later, the monkey escapes to the house of Zayda and her mother (the father having died). The mother becomes convinced it is Alphege, and then the Good Queen appears to her in a dream. She and Zayda follow the Good Queen's instructions and restore Alphege. Meanwhile, the wicked queen implores the king to kill an ""impostor"" raised up by plotters of a revolt. Instead, he makes inquiries and goes to confront the women at their home. He is astounded to meet Alphege, and immediately renounces his crown. At the palace, Alphege displays the ruby talisman, which splits with a loud noise, and the wicked queen dies. Alphege marries Zayda and shares the throne with his stepbrother."
amis_et_amiles,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amis_et_Amiles,Amis et Amiles,"Amis et Amiles is an old French romance based on a widespread legend of friendship and sacrifice. In its earlier and simpler form it is the story of two friends, one of whom, Amis, was sick with leprosy because he had committed perjury to save his friend. A vision informed him that he could only be cured by bathing in the blood of Amiles's children. When Amiles learnt this he killed the children, who were, however, miraculously restored to life after the cure of Amis.The tale found its way into French literature through the medium of Latin, as the names Amicus and Amelius indicate, and was eventually attached to the Carolingian cycle in the 12th-century chanson de geste of Amis et Amiles. This poem is written in decasyllabic assonanced verse, each stanza being terminated by a short line. It belongs to the heroic period of French epic, containing some passages of great beauty, notably the episode of the slaying of the children, and maintains a high level of poetry throughout.The oldest version is a Latin poem composed around 1090 by Radulphus Tortarius, a monk of Fleury. The opening lines suggests that the poet was retelling a popular tale: Historiam Gallus, breviter quam replico, novit... (The Gaul knows the tale, which I am briefly telling...). More distant origins are rooted in folklore.","Amis has married Lubias and become count of Blaives (Blaye), while Amiles has become seneschal at the court of Charlemagne, and is seduced by the emperor's daughter, Bellisant. The lovers are betrayed, and Amiles is unable to find the necessary supporters to enable him to clear himself by the ordeal of single combat, and fears, moreover, to fight in a false cause. He is granted a reprieve, and goes in search of Amis, who engages to personate him in the combat. He thus saves his friend, but in so doing perjures himself. Then follows the leprosy of Amis, and, after a lapse of years, his discovery of Amiles and cure.
There are obvious reminiscences in this story of Damon and Pythias, and of the classical instances of sacrifice at the divine command. The legend of Amis and Amiles occurs in many forms with slight variations, the names and positions of the friends being sometimes reversed. The crown of martyrdom was not lacking, for Amis and Amiles were slain by Ogier the Dane at Novara on their way home from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.Jourdain de Blaives, a chanson de geste which partly reproduces the story of Apollonius of Tyre, was attached to the geste of Amis by making Jourdain his grandson."
ancilotto__king_of_provino,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancilotto,_King_of_Provino","Ancilotto, King of Provino","Ancilotto, King of Provino is an Italian literary fairy tale written by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola.It is Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 707: ""The Three Golden Children"" or  ""the dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird"". It is the oldest known variant of this tale, and influenced Madame d'Aulnoy's Princess Belle-Etoile. A variant of this tale appears in Antoine Galland's Arabian Nights collection, but no Arab manuscript exists, and Galland, reporting an oral source, may also have been influenced by this version. It spread to appear as The Three Little Birds in the Brothers Grimm's collection.

","Ancilotto, the king, heard three sisters talking:  Brunora, the eldest sister, said if she married the king's majordomo, she could give the entire court a drink from one glass of water; Lionella, the second, said if she married the king's chamberlain, she could turn one spindle of linen to give fine shifts to the entire court; Chiaretta, the youngest said if she married the king, she would give him triplets who would have fine hair with gold, a gold necklace, and a star on their forehead.  The king married them off as they had said.  The Queen mother was angry to have such a daughter-in-law.  The king had to leave, and while he was gone, Chiaretta gave birth to two sons and a daughter, as she had described.  Three black puppies with white stars had been born, and Chiaretta's sisters brought them to the queen.  The queen substituted them for the babies, and the babies were put in a box and thrown into the river.  A miller, Marmiato, found them.  His wife, Gordiana, named the boys Acquirino and Fluvio, and the girl Serena.
Ancilotto was grief-stricken by the story, but when the Queen mother, the midwife, and the queen's sisters all agreed that Chiaretta had given birth to the puppies, he ordered her kept in the dungeon.
Gordiana gave birth to a son, named Borghino. Marmiato and Gordiana learned that if they cut the children's hair, gems fell out of it, and they lived prosperously; but when the children grew up, they learned that they were foundlings and set out.  They found Ancilotto's land and met him; he told his mother that he thought they were the children Chiaretta had borne him.
The Queen mother sent the midwife after them, and she tricked Serena into asking for the dancing water.  Acquirino and Fluvio went after it; a dove warned them of the danger and then filled up a vial for them.  Ancilotto saw them again, and the Queen mother heard of their survival.  The midwife tricked Serena into asking for the singing apple. Acquirino and Fluvio went after it, and on the way, their host one night warned them of the danger, and then gave them a robe of mirrors.  This would trick the monster that guarded it, when it saw its own reflection.  Fluvio used it and picked the apple.  Ancilotto saw them again, and the queen learned they had survived.  The midwife tricked Serena into asking for a beautiful green bird that could speak words of wisdom day and night, and when Acquirino and Fluvio found the garden with the bird, they looked at marble statues in it, and were turned into statues themselves.
Serena awaited them anxiously and finally set out after them.  She reached the garden, snuck up on the bird, and caught it.  It begged for its freedom, and showed her how to turn her brothers back to life. Serena said she would free it only if it brought them to their mother and father.
They went to Ancilotto's palace for dinner and brought the water, apple, and bird.  The king and guests marveled at the water and apple, and the bird asked what punishment should be imposed on those who tried to kill two brothers and a sister.  The queen mother said death by burning, and everyone agreed.  The bird told the story of Chiaretta's children; the king freed her and had his mother, her sisters, and the midwife burned."
asmund_and_signy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmund_and_Signy,Asmund and Signy,"Asmund and Signy is an Icelandic fairy tale collected in Islandische Märchen.  Andrew Lang included it in The Brown Fairy Book.

","A king and queen had a son, Asmund, and a daughter, Signy.  Asmund loved the outdoors.  He persuaded his father to give him two giant oaks, and told Signy that he would hollow them out and live in them. Signy asked to live there, too, and Asmund agreed.  They lived there a time, when their father had to go to war, and their mother died...
Nearby, a king had a son, Prince Ring, who had heard of Signy's beauty and was determined to marry her.  When setting out in search for her, he met a beautiful woman who told him she was Signy and explained her being alone on the way as stemming from her grief at her mother's death; she was, in fact, a gigantic witch.  He told her he wished to marry her.  She agreed but said she had to go into the woods and would join him at the ship.  In the woods, she tore up the two oaks and carried them with her.  Ring carried her home, where she was made welcome, and the oaks were planted outside her windows.
The prince asked her when they could marry, she agreed to a date, and he brought her fine cloth to make her wedding gown.  As soon as he left, she took on her own shape and raged, because she could not sew and would soon starve if her brother did not bring her raw meat and bones.  A giant brought her meat, but she still raged over the cloth.
Asmund asked Signy to sew the cloth, because otherwise they would have no peace.  Signy did so, and Ring was pleased with the clothing.  But the witch continued to rave about her food.  Finally, Asmund brought Ring to listen to her plans after the wedding:  slaughtering the courtiers and bringing her relatives, the giants, to court.  Ring burned down the house with both her and her brother in it. 
Ring fell in love with Signy at sight, and Asmund with Ring's sister, so they had a double wedding, and Asmund returned with his bride to his father's kingdom."
babiole,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babiole,Babiole,"Babiole is a French literary fairy tale, written by Madame d'Aulnoy. In English publications, the name is sometimes translated as Babiola.

","A queen thought she was childless because of the ill wishes of the fairy, Fanferluche.  One day, Fanferluche appeared to her to say that this was not true, that the queen would have a daughter who would bring her much woe, and that to avert this, Fanferluche would give her a branch of hawthorn to be attached to the child's head.  After the birth, the queen had this done, and the ugly princess was instantly turned into a monkey.  The queen caught the monkey and removed the branch but this did not restore the princess.  A lady-in-waiting persuaded the queen to tell the king the baby had died and persuaded her that the monkey should be thrown into the sea.  The queen agreed and the princess/monkey was put into a box.  On the way to the sea, the servant took the monkey out of the box, deciding to keep the box for himself. Meanwhile, the queen's sister, with her four-year-old son, came by.  She had heard of the birth, and then of the death. The son saw the monkey and wanted to keep it.  So, the monkey was raised in his chambers.  When she was four, the monkey started to speak.  The boy's mother (the queen of another region) took her from the prince and showed her off to all the ambassadors, and educated her.  The monkey princess had fallen in love with her cousin, unbeknownst to him.  
The king of the monkeys, Magot, decided to marry her.  The queen favored his suit when the ambassadors arrived.  Babiole did not wish to marry him, but the queen said it would prevent war, and the prince mocked her when she declared her love.  So, Babiole ran away.  Attempting to swim a river, she sank to the bottom, to a grotto where an old man, the King of the Fish, welcomed her.  He told her the prince would marry only the most beautiful princess in the world, warned her not to lose the glass chest Magot sent her, for it would help her, and gave her a tortoise to ride.  She set out on it, but Magot's ambassador spotted her, and she was captured.  
They made her travel in a state carriage until the company reached a city, which was that of Babiole's parents.  The queen had forbidden any kind of monkey to enter it, and this struck her with horror.  The monkeys were captured.  Babiole, however, was prettily dressed, and they had heard of her.  She soon charmed her captors and lived pleasantly.  The queen saw her and was quite taken.  They talked, and the queen realized that Babiole was her transformed child.  Her ladies in waiting told her that her reputation demanded that she shut Babiole up in a castle.  Babiole heard this and fled. 
Finding no food, she opened the glass chest and went to eat an olive inside it.  Oil flowed from it and turned her into a beautiful princess.  But still hungry, she went to eat the hazel nut in the box, and out of it came people who made her a castle and attended her in it.  She lived there as a queen.  Several tournaments were held in her honor.  
One day, some knights fought and were wounded.  She descended to reason with them, and found her cousin was one, and nearly dead.  She had him tended to, but soon found that her love for him caused him agony, and she fled.  The fairy Fanferluche carried her off and imprisoned her in a glass bottle.  
The prince set out in search of her.  He met the king of the fishes, who told him where she was.  Armed and on a winged dolphin given by the king, he rescued her.  She told him her story, and he regretted his scorn.  They married and reconciled their kingdoms."
baemsillang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baemsillang,Baemsillang,"Baemsillang: Gureongdeongdeong sinseonbi (Hangul: 뱀신랑: 구렁덩덩신선비; English: The Snake Husband: The Divine Serpent Scholar) is a Korean folktale about a woman married to a snake (baem) who breaks a promise with her husband (sillang) and conquers adversity to reunite with him. This tale of a snake shedding its skin to become a man is also known as Gureongdeongdeong sinseonbi in Korea, which means ""divine serpent scholar."" The hardships the wife endures while searching for her husband is regarded by some as analogous to a priest attempting to once more receive a deity.

","Once upon a time, there lived an old couple. One day, the old wife finally became pregnant, giving birth to a snake. The old wife kept the snake in the backyard. One of the neighbors happened to have three daughters who decided to pay a visit upon hearing rumors that the old woman next door had given birth. However, discovering that a snake had been born, they were all disgusted except for the youngest daughter. Upon witnessing the snake, the third daughter said the old woman had given birth to a divine serpent scholar. When the snake grew up, it begged its mother to propose his marriage to one of their neighbor's daughters. The mother went next door to propose, but the eldest and second daughters refused. The third daughter accepted the proposal and married the snake.
On their wedding night, the snake asked his bride to prepare a crock of soy sauce, a crock of flour, and a crock of water. The snake then slid into the crock of soy sauce, rolled about in the crock of flour, and finally bathed in the crock of water. When it came out, the snake had shed its skin and turned into a handsome scholar. The bride's elder sisters grew jealous when they saw that their younger sister was living with such an exceptionally handsome gentleman.
One day, the snake husband made his wife promise not to show anyone his skin and went off to take the government service examination in Seoul. Unfortunately, the wife's elder sisters came over to secretly search for the snakeskin and burned it. Sensing from Seoul that his skin had been burned, the serpent scholar disappeared. When her husband failed to return home, the wife set out to look for him. On her way, she met a crow, a wild boar, a woman doing laundry and a farmer plowing the field and did what each of them asked her to do in order to learn of her husband's whereabouts.
By the time the wife caught up with him, the serpent scholar had already remarried and was living with another woman. He decided to give tasks to the two women and stay with the one who performed them better. The tasks involved challenges like chopping firewood, drawing water, and sneaking a hair from a tiger's eyebrow, which the first wife carried out successfully while the second wife did not. The serpent scholar thus left his second wife and went back to living happily ever after with his first wife."

It is similar to the Brothers Grimm's ""The Crystal Orb"" (Aarne–Thompson type 552A).

","A king has three sons and three daughters. On his deathbed he makes his sons swear that they will marry off their sisters to the first person who asks. One night a booming voice demands that one sister be given to him. The two older brothers are reluctant, while the youngest (the Least of Three) heeds his father's dying request and hands her over. The same thing happens for the next two nights, until all the sisters are given away to mysterious strangers. The three brothers then decide to go and search for their sisters.
Throughout their travels, each brother fights many-headed serpents, the youngest tossing the serpent into a lake putting out their camp fire; so he has to go out alone to find fire, and using his wits he defeats nine giants that were terrorizing the region. Finally, he rescues a princess from the giant's village and is allowed to marry the princess.  He lives in her castle and is allowed to visit any of the rooms, except one which is bound with chains (the One Forbidden Thing). When his wife is away from the castle, he goes inside the room and comes across a man bound in chains. The man calls himself Baš Čelik, and he begs for three glasses of water. Every time Čelik drains a glass, the prince receives an extra life. When the third glass is handed to him, Čelik regains his massive strength, breaks the chains, opens his wings, and flies away with the youngest son's wife.
Now the prince sets out on a new quest to rescue his wife. On the way, he discovers that his sisters were married to the Lords of Dragons, Hawks and Eagles. He visits their castles and is welcomed. But when he tells each Lord of his plans to defeat Čelik, they try to stop him, telling him its impossible.  The young prince refuses to listen, so each Lord gives him a magical feather that when burned will summon their armies. He tries to rescue his wife but each time, fails and loses his life. On the fourth time he fails again and dies, but not before he burns the feathers and his body is saved by his brothers-in-law.  They resurrect him using the magical water from River Jordan. At this point the prince's wife learns that Čelik cannot be killed, because his life is in a bird that is in a heart of fox in a forest of a high mountain. Helped by the Lords, the prince finally slays Čelik and rescues his wife."

It was included in her revised edition, published in 1753, of Henriette-Julie de Murat's last novel, Les Lutins du château de Kernosy (The Sprites of Kernosy Castle, 1710), which is why it is often attributed to Madame Henriette-Julie de Murat.

","A king and queen had lost all their children except a daughter, whom they were in no hurry to marry off.  The king of the ogres, Rhinoceros, heard of her and decided to marry her; when he threatened the kingdom with his ogres, the king decided he had no choice.  When she was told of the ogre's threat, the princess agreed and set out with a companion, Corianda, with whom she was close.  Corianda had tried to get the princess' fairy godmother to help, but she had refused because the king had not consulted her.  Rhinoceros met them in his rhinoceros form.  The princess fainted.  Rhinoceros carried them both to his castle, and turned to his own form, which was as ugly.  The princess' distress annoyed him, and he left to hunt bears.  Corianda suggested that the princess hide in a bearskin, and sewed her into one, but that act turned her into a she-bear.  They thought her fairy godmother was responsible.  In that form, Corianda let her out to run away and told the ogre that he had eaten her in his rage.  The ogre set out to search, but her fairy godmother had led her to a boat in which she escaped to another kingdom.
The king of that kingdom found her (in her form as a she-bear) while hunting and her gentle behavior persuaded him to take her captive rather than kill her.  She fell in love with him, but her ugliness made her despair.  Her fairy godmother, in the form of a fish, bade her wait, and at midnight, turned her back into a princess.  Then she warned her that she had to put back on the bearskin every morning, though she could take it off at night, which the princess obeyed.  The king, meanwhile, had come to the conclusion that he had fallen in love with the bear, which shocked him.  One day, he was in her presence when she turned back to a princess.  Her fairy godmother told him to go and arrange a wedding.  He did so.  The bear came, and was turned into a princess before the court.  They married and in two years had two young sons.
The ogre heard of their wedding and set out with his seven-league boots.  In the kingdom, he disguised himself and offered to give golden distaffs and silver spindles to the nurses and governesses of the young princes if he could spend a night in the babies' chamber.  When they agreed, he cut the babies' throats with the queen's knife and went off to disguise himself as an astrologer.  In that form, he assured the king that the murderer lived in the castle.  The bloody knife was found and the queen condemned to death.  The queen lamented her fate but was glad to die having lost her husband's love.  The king was moved by this and could not bring himself to have her die, but was unable to speak loudly enough to stop the servants.  Her fairy godmother appeared by the stake with the two princes and Corianda to reveal the ogre as the killer and restore the princes to their parents."

A variant from Sicily, ""Don Giovanni de la Fortuna"", was collected by Laura Gonzenbach in Sicilianische Märchen and included by Andrew Lang in The Pink Fairy Book. Italo Calvino included another Italian version, ""The Devil's Breeches"" from Bologna, in his Italian Folktales.The tale is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 361 (Bearskin), in which a man gains a fortune and a beautiful bride by entering into a pact with the devil.

","A man was a soldier, but when war ended, his parents were dead, and his brothers had no place for him.
A green-coated man with a cloven hoof appeared to him and offered to make him rich if he would for seven years not cut his hair, clip his nails, bathe, or pray, and wear a coat and cloak that he would give him. At the end, if he survived, he would be rich and free. If he died during the time, the devil would have him. The desperate soldier agreed and the devil gave him the green coat telling him he would find its pockets always full of limitless money and then a bearskin, telling him that he must sleep in it and would be known as Bearskin because of it.
Bearskin set out, and gave much money to the poor that they would pray for him, to live out the seven years. After several years, he grew so revolting that he had to pay heavily to get any shelter. In the fourth year, he heard an old man lamenting and persuaded him to tell his tale: he had lost all his money, did not know how to provide for his daughters and could not pay the innkeeper, so he would be sent to jail. Bearskin paid the innkeeper and gave the old man a purse of gold as well.

The old man said that he would marry him to one of his daughters in gratitude. The oldest ran away, screaming, from the sight. The middle one said he was worse than a bear that had tried to pass itself off as human. The youngest one agreed to fulfill her father's promise. Bearskin gave her half a ring and promised to return in three years. Her sisters ridiculed her at length.
At the end of the seven years, Bearskin found the devil again and demanded he fulfill his promise. The devil then proceeds to bathe Bearskin, clip his nails and cut his hair until he is as good as new. Bearskin then demands that the devil say the Lord's prayer. The devil warns Bearskin not to push his luck as he has already won their bargain and disappears. Clean and with his money, he dressed himself as a fine gentleman and went to the old man's house, where the older sisters served him, and his bride (dressed in black) showed no reaction to him. He told the old man that he would marry one of his daughters. The two older sisters ran off to dress splendidly, and Bearskin dropped his half of the ring into a wine cup and gave it to his bride. She drank it and realized that he was her bridegroom.
They married. Upon realizing who he was and what they gave up, one sister hanged herself in rage and the other drowned herself. That night, the devil knocked on the door to tell Bearskin that he had gotten two souls for the price of one."

Indeed, it is sometimes titled Cinderella in English translation.

","Once upon a time, a man married two wives, and each bore a baby girl. The child of the first wife was beautiful and was called Beauty, but her sister who was a year younger than her, had a pocked face and was called Pock Face. Pock Face was the second wife's daughter. The wicked stepmother was jealous of her stepdaughter's loveliness so she abused Beauty and made her do all of the dirty tasks in the house. Beauty's mother, who died of childbirth, returned in the shape of a yellow cow.  The yellow cow did all of the work for her, but the stepmother found out and had the cow killed.  Beauty collected the bones and put them in a pot.
One day, there was a festival in town. Her stepmother clothed Pock Face nicely, but refused to take the poor Beauty along with her. Beauty out of rage broke everything in house, even the pot, and when she did that a horse, a dress, and a lovely pair of shoes came out.  She dressed herself and rode the horse, and off she went to the festival.
She lost one of her lovely shoes in a ditch, and afraid to get her clothes dirty asked three men to get the shoe. Each one agreed if she would marry him.  She refused a fishmonger for smelling of fish, a rich merchant for being covered with dust, and an oil trader for being greasy. But she consented with a wealthy scholar, for he was neither smelly, dusty nor greasy, but just right.
Three days after the wedding, Beauty went to pay her respects to her parents.  Pock Face lured her near a well, pushed her in, and then sent word to the scholar that Beauty had caught smallpox.  After a time, she went herself and explained her looks by the illness.  Beauty, however, shapeshifted into a sparrow and came to taunt Pock Face while she was combing her hair; Pock Face taunted her back.  The scholar heard Beauty and asked her to fly into a golden cage if she were his wife; she duly came.  Pock Face then killed the sparrow and buried it.  Bamboo shot up on the grave.  The shoots tasted delicious to the scholar but gave Pock Face ulcers on her tongue.  Pock Face cut the bamboo down and had a bed made from it, but though the scholar found it comfortable, it poked Pock Face with needles, so she threw it out.  An old woman took it home.  The old woman found that dinner was cooked for her whenever she came home.  In time, she caught Beauty's spirit at work. Beauty then had the old woman give her some magical ingredients: a bowl for her stomach, some chopsticks for her bones, and some juice for her blood. Beauty thus, became flesh and blood again.
Beauty gave the old woman a bag to sell by her husband's mansion.  When she did so, the scholar questioned Beauty and brought her back home.  Pock Face proposed tests to determine who was the genuine wife.  First they walked on eggs; Beauty did not break any, and Pock Face broke them all, but she would not admit it.  Then they climbed a ladder of knives; Beauty did not cut her feet, and Pock Face did, but she would not admit it.  Finally, they jumped into boiling oil; Beauty emerged alive, but Pock Face died.  Beauty sent her body back to her stepmother, but her stepmother thought it was carp.  When she saw it was her daughter, she fell down dead."
beauty_and_the_beast,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast,Beauty and the Beast,"Beauty and the Beast (French: La Belle et la Bête) is a fairy tale written by French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and published in 1740 in La Jeune Américaine et les contes marins (The Young American and Marine Tales). Her lengthy version was abridged, rewritten, and published by French novelist Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1756 in Magasin des enfants (Children's Collection) to produce the version most commonly retold. Later, Andrew Lang retold the story in Blue Fairy Book, a part of the Fairy Book series, in 1889. The fairy tale was influenced by Ancient Greek stories such as ""Cupid and Psyche"" from The Golden Ass, written by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis in the second century AD, and The Pig King, an Italian fairytale published by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola around 1550.Variants of the tale are known across Europe. In France, for example, Zémire and Azor is an operatic version of the story, written by Marmontel and composed by Grétry in 1771, which had enormous success into the 19th century. Zémire and Azor is based on the second version of the tale. Amour pour amour (Love for love), by Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée, is a 1742 play based on de Villeneuve's version. According to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated about 4,000 years ago.","A widower merchant lives in a mansion with his twelve children (six sons and six daughters). All his daughters are very beautiful, but the youngest daughter, was named “little beauty” for she was the most gorgeous among all of them. She continued to be named “Beauty” till she was a young adult. She was the most lovely, as well as kind, well-read, and pure of heart; while the elder sisters, in contrast, are cruel, selfish, vain, spoiled and were jealous of the little beauty. The merchant eventually loses all of his wealth in a tempest at sea, which sinks most of his merchant fleet. He and his children are consequently forced to live in a small cottage in a forest and work for a living. While Beauty makes a firm resolution to adjust to rural life with a cheerful disposition, her sisters do not and mistake her determination for stupidity.

Some years later, the merchant hears that one of the trade ships he had sent has arrived back in port, having escaped the destruction of its companions. Before leaving, he asks his children if they wish for him to bring any gifts back for them. His oldest daughters ask for clothing, jewels, and the finest dresses possible as they think that his wealth has returned. Beauty asks for nothing but her father to be safe, but when he insists on buying her a present, she is satisfied with the promise of a rose, as none grow in their part of the country. The merchant, to his dismay, finds that his ship's cargo has been seized to pay his debts, leaving him penniless and unable to buy his children's presents.

During his return, the merchant becomes lost during a vicious storm. Seeking shelter, he comes upon a castle. Seeing that no one is home, the merchant sneaks in and finds tables inside laden with food and drink, which seem to have been left for him by the castle's invisible owner. The merchant accepts this gift and spends the night there. The next morning, the merchant has come to view the palace as his own possession and is about to leave to fetch his children when he sees a rose garden and recalls that Beauty had desired a rose. The merchant quickly plucks the loveliest rose he can find, and is about to pluck more to create a bouquet, only to end up being confronted by a hideous ""Beast"" who tries to kill him for stealing of his most precious possession even after accepting his hospitality. The merchant begs to be set free, revealing that he had only picked the rose as a gift for his youngest daughter. The Beast agrees to let him give the rose to Beauty, but only if the merchant brings one of his daughters to take his place without deception; he makes it clear that she must agree to take his place while under no illusions about her predicament.

The merchant is upset, but accepts this condition for the sake of his own life, as he has no choice. The Beast sends him on his way with wealth, jewels, and fine clothes for his sons and daughters, and stresses that he must not lie to his daughters. The merchant, upon arriving home, hands Beauty the rose she requested and informs her that it had a terrible price, before relaying what had happened during his absence. Her brothers say that they will go to the castle and fight the Beast, while his older daughters refuse to leave and place blame on Beauty, urging her to right her own wrong. The merchant dissuades them, forbidding his children from ever going near the Beast. Beauty willingly decides to go to the Beast's castle and the following morning she and her father set out atop a magical horse that the Beast has provided them. The Beast receives her with great ceremony and her arrival is greeted with fireworks entwining their initials. He gives her lavish clothing and food and carries on lengthy conversations with her and she notes that he is inclined to stupidity rather than savagery. Every night, the Beast asks Beauty to marry him, only to be refused each time. After each refusal, Beauty dreams of a handsome prince with whom she begins to fall in love. Despite the apparition of a fairy urging her not to be deceived by appearances, she does not make the connection between the prince and the Beast and becomes convinced that the Beast is holding him captive somewhere in the castle. She searches and discovers many enchanted rooms containing sources of entertainment ranging from libraries to aviaries to enchanted windows allowing her to attend the theatre. She also comes across many animals, including parrots and monkeys, which act as servants, but never the unknown prince from her dreams.

For several months, Beauty lives a life of luxury at the Beast's castle, having every whim catered to, with no end of riches to amuse her and an endless supply of exquisite finery to wear. Eventually, she becomes homesick and begs the Beast to allow her to go see her family again. He allows it on the condition that she returns exactly two months later. Beauty agrees to this and is presented with an enchanted ring, which allows her to wake up in her family's new home in an instant when turned three times around her finger. Her older sisters are surprised to find her well-fed and dressed in finery, and their old jealousy quickly flares when their suitors' gazes turn to Beauty, even though she bestows lavish gifts on them and informs the men that she is only there to witness her sisters' weddings. However, Beauty's heart is moved by her father's overprotectiveness, and she reluctantly agrees to stay longer.

When the two months have passed, she envisions the Beast dying alone on the castle grounds and hastens to return despite her brothers' resolve to prevent her from doing so. Once she is back in the castle, Beauty's fears are confirmed, and she finds the Beast near death in a cave on the grounds. Seeing this, Beauty is distraught, realizing that she loves him. Despite this, she remains calm and fetches water from a nearby spring, which she uses to resuscitate him. That night, she agrees to marry him. and when she wakes up next to him, she finds that the Beast has transformed into the unknown Prince from her dreams. This is followed by the arrival of the fairy who had previously advised her in her dreams, along with a woman she does not recognize, in a golden carriage pulled by white stags. The woman turns out to be the Prince's mother whose joy quickly falters when she finds out that Beauty is not of noble birth. The fairy chastises the mother and eventually reveals that Beauty is her niece with her actual father being the Queen's brother from Fortunate Island and her mother being the fairy's sister.

When the matter of Beauty's background is resolved, she requests that the Prince tell his tale, and so he does. The Prince informs her that his father died when he was young and his mother had to wage war to defend his kingdom. The queen left him in the care of an evil fairy, who tried to seduce him when he became an adult; when he refused, she transformed him into a beast. Only by finding true love, despite his ugliness, could the curse be broken. He and Beauty are married, and they live happily ever after together."
bella_venezia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Venezia,Bella Venezia,"""Bella Venezia"" is an Italian fairy tale collected by Italo Calvino in his Italian Folktales. Calvino selected this variant, where the heroine meets robbers, rather than others that contain dwarfs, because he believed the dwarfs were probably an importation from Germany. It is Aarne-Thompson type 709, Snow White.  Others of this type include Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree, Nourie Hadig, La petite Toute-Belle, and Myrsina.

","An innkeeper named Bella Venezia asked her customers whether they had ever seen a more beautiful woman than herself. When they said they had not, she cut the price for their stay in half, but one day, a traveller said that he had seen such a woman: her own daughter. Bella Venezia doubled the price of his stay instead of halving it; and had her daughter shut in a tower with a single window.
But the daughter escaped and wandered until she saw twelve robbers order a cave open and shut: ""Open up, desert!"" and ""Close up, desert!"" She snuck inside and cleaned up the place, and then stole some of their food before hiding. The robbers set watch, but each robber waited outside, for the person to sneak in, and so did not catch her, until the chief robber waited inside and saw her. He told her not to be afraid: she could stay and be their little sister. But one day a robber went to Bella Venezia's inn, and told her that a girl they had with them was more beautiful than Bella.
A witch begged every day from the inn, and Bella Venezia promised her half her fortune if she could put an end to the daughter. The witch went into the forest as a pedlar, persuaded the girl to let her in, and while showing her a hair pin, thrust it into the girl's head. The robbers found her body, wept, and buried her in a hollow tree.
One day, a prince went hunting, and his dogs sniffed out the tree where the girl was buried. He took her body back to the castle and could not bear to be away from her. His mother was angry and said that he could at least fix her hair. This revealed the pin. When it was pulled out, the girl awoke, and the prince married her."

","A marquis had no children. One day, his wife slept in the garden, and a grass snake slithered into her womb. Soon afterwards, she became pregnant and gave birth to a girl with a snake wrapped about her neck; the midwives were frightened, but the snake slithered off into the garden without harming anyone.
The girl was named Biancabella. When she turned ten, the snake spoke to her in the garden, telling her that she was her sister, Samaritana, and that if Biancabella obeyed her, she would be happy but miserable if she did not. The snake then ordered her to bring two buckets, one of milk and one of rosewater. When Biancabella returned to the house, she was distressed so her mother asked her what made her so sad. Biancabella asked for the buckets, which her mother gave her, and she carried them into the garden. The snake then had Biancabella bathe in the buckets. She became even more beautiful, and when her hair was combed it shed jewels, and when her hands were washed, they shed flowers.
This attracted many suitors. Finally, her father agreed to marry her to Ferrandino, King of Naples. After the wedding, Biancabella called on Samaritana, but the snake did not come to her. Biancabella realized she must have disobeyed her and grieved for the snake, but left with her husband. Ferrandino's stepmother, who wanted to marry him to one of her ugly daughters, was enraged. Some time later, Ferrandino had to go to war; while he was gone, his stepmother ordered her servants to take Biancabella away and kill her, bringing back proof of her death. They took her away, and while they did not kill her, they gouged out her eyes and cut off her hands. The stepmother gave word that her own daughters had died, and that the queen had miscarried and was ill; then, she put her own daughter into Biancabella's bed. Ferrandino, returning, was greatly distressed.
Biancabella called on Samaritana, who still did not come. An old man brought her to his home; his wife rebuked him, because she had doubtlessly been punished for some crime, but he insisted. Biancabella asked one of his three daughters to comb her hair; the old woman did not want her daughter to be a servant, but the girl obeyed and jewels came out of Biancabella's hair. The family was greatly pleased because she had delivered them from poverty. After a time, Biancabella asked the old man to bring her back to where she had been found, and there she called on Samaritana until she finally thought of killing herself. Samaritana appeared to stop her, and Biancabella appealed for forgiveness.  Samaritana restored her eyes and hands, and then herself transformed into a woman.
After a time, the sisters, the old man and woman, and their daughters went to Naples, where Samaritana built them a house magically. Ferrandino saw the women, and they told him that they had been exiled and had come there to live. He brought the women of court, including his stepmother, to the castle, where Samaritana told a servant to sing Biancabella's story without including the names. Then she asked what would be a fitting punishment. The stepmother, thinking to evade notice, said she should be cast into a red-hot furnace. Samaritana told the king the truth; Ferrandino ordered the stepmother to be thrown into a furnace, married off the old man's three daughters well, and lived happily with Biancabella until he died, and his son succeeded him."

At last, the girl and the bull arrive at a valley of glass.
""You must wait here,"" the bull tells the girl, ""and whatever you do, do not move, even an inch, or I will not be able to find you"". He goes on to explain that he is to fight the devil who rules the valley so that they may exit. If the sky turns blue, then she will know that the bull has won; but if the sky turns red, then he has lost. The black bull leaves the girl there, and after some time she sees the sky turn blue. Overjoyed, the girl shifts her position slightly... and so the black bull does not return for her.
Unable to climb out of the valley on her own, the girl wanders alone until she finds a blacksmith. He tells her that if she serves him for seven years, he will repay her by making her a pair of shoes. When seven years have gone by, the blacksmith, true to his word, makes the girl—now a young woman—a pair of iron shoes, and nails them to her feet. With the shoes, the young woman is able to climb out of the glass valley.
The young woman eventually wanders back to the home of the witch, who offers her shelter if she will wash some bloody shirts that both she and her daughter have been unable to clean. Whoever could clean the shirts would marry the gallant young knight staying at the witch's home, whom the shirts belong to. Despite the failure of those before her, no sooner has the young woman touched the soap to the shirts than the bloodstains vanish, and the young woman's feet heal perfectly, as if they had never been bloodied or injured. Delighted, the witch brings the knight his shirts and convinces him that it was her daughter who cleaned them. Thus, the knight and the daughter are to be married.

Desperate, the young woman realizes that she is in the first great need of her life. She breaks open the apple, and finds it full of rich jewelry. She offers the jewelry to the witch's daughter, in exchange for being allowed to sing outside the knight's room at night. But the witch gives her daughter a sleeping-drink to offer the knight, so the young woman cannot wake him, though she sobs and sings:

""Seven long years I served for thee,
The glassy hill I clamb for thee,
Thy bloody clothes I wrang for thee;
And wilt thou not waken and turn to me?""She is in the second great need of her life, so she tries the pear, and finds it full of jewelry richer than that of the apple, but the second night goes as before. Finally, the young woman is in the third great need of her life, and breaks the plum to find the richest jewelry yet. This time, though the sleeping-drink is brought again, the knight accidentally knocks it over, so, when the young woman buys her third and final chance, the knight is awake to hear her song. In this way he learns the truth.
The young woman marries the knight, who had been her black bull all along. He has the witch and her daughter burned, and the knight and the washerwoman's youngest daughter live happily ever after."
bluebeard,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard,Bluebeard,"""Bluebeard"" (French: Barbe bleue, [baʁb(ə) blø]) is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in Histoires ou contes du temps passé. The tale tells the story of a wealthy man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. ""The White Dove"", ""The Robber Bridegroom"" and ""Fitcher's Bird"" (also called ""Fowler's Fowl"") are tales similar to ""Bluebeard"". The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word ""Bluebeard"" the definition of ""a man who marries and kills one wife after another"". The verb ""bluebearding"" has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women.

","In one version of the story, Bluebeard is a wealthy and powerful nobleman who has been married several times to beautiful women who have all mysteriously vanished. When Bluebeard visits his neighbor and asks to marry one of his daughters, the girls are terrified. After hosting a wonderful banquet, the youngest daughter decides to be his wife and she goes to live with him in his rich and luxurious palace in the countryside, away from her family.
Bluebeard announces that he must leave for the country and gives the keys of the château to his wife. She is able to open any door in the house with them, each of which contain some of his riches, except for an underground chamber that he strictly forbids her to enter lest she suffer his wrath. He then goes away and leaves the house and the keys in her hands. She invites her sister, Anne, and her friends and cousins over for a party. However, she is eventually overcome with the desire to see what the forbidden room holds, and she sneaks away from the party and ventures into the room.
She immediately discovers the room is flooded with blood and the murdered corpses of Bluebeard's former wives hanging on hooks from the walls. Horrified, she drops the key in the blood and flees the room. She tries to wash the blood from the key, but the key is magical and the blood cannot be removed. Bluebeard unexpectedly returns and finds the bloody key. In a blind rage, he threatens to kill his wife on the spot, but she asks for one last prayer with her sister Anne. Then, as Bluebeard is about to deliver the fatal blow, Anne and the wife's brothers arrive and kill Bluebeard. The wife inherits his fortune and castle, and has the dead wives buried. She uses the fortune to have her other siblings married then remarries herself, finally moving on from her horrible experience with Bluebeard."

The troll is, as commonly depicted, not very intelligent and has poor vision, while the boy is clever, outwitting the troll to win an eating contest.","A farmer sent his sons to cut wood in a forest he owned, to pay off debts.  A troll threatened them as they came, one by one; the two older ones allowed themselves to be chased off, but the youngest son (known in Norwegian as Askeladden 'Ash-lad', or called Boots in some versions), asked his mother for food before going out.  When the troll threatened him, the boy pulled out some cheese, claiming it was a stone, and squeezed it until whey came out.  When he threatened to deal with the troll as he had with the ""stone"", the troll offered to help him with the wood-cutting.
The troll suggested that the boy come home with him.  Then he went to build up the fire and sent the boy for water.  The boy realized he could not carry the huge buckets, so he declared they were too small, and said he would just fetch the entire spring.  The troll, not wanting to lose his spring, exchanged chores with him.
When the porridge was made, they had an eating match, but the boy put more into his scrip than into his stomach, and when it was full, he cut a hole in it.  The troll said he could eat no more.  The boy suggested that he cut a hole in his stomach, which would let him eat as much as he liked, and it didn't hurt much.
The troll did so, and died, and the boy took his gold and silver and paid off the family debt."

","A king had his castle shadowed by a great oak tree, and had no well that held water year round.  He declared that whoever cut down the oak and dug the well would have the princess and half the kingdom.
Three brothers, who had set out because their father was too poor to give them anything, were going to his palace.  The youngest son heard something hewing, and went off.  He found an axe that was hewing by itself, and it said that it had been waiting for him.  He took it and went back, telling his brother that it had been an axe, and endured their ridicule.  Again, he heard something digging, found a shovel digging by itself, and took it as well; then he wondered where a brook came from, and found not a spring but a walnut, which he stopped up with moss.
When they reached the king, he had decreed that whoever tried and failed would have his ears clipped off and be put on a deserted island.  The two older tried, failed, and suffered the punishment.  The youngest set the axe to cut down the tree, the spade to dig the well, and the nut to fill it.
The story says that it was just as well that the brothers lost their ears, because it spared them hearing people's comments that their youngest brother had not been a fool to wonder."

","An old man burned in hell.  His three sons set out to seek their fortune.  The two older would have nothing to do with the youngest son, who they said was fit for nothing but to sit and poke about in ashes.  The youngest brought a kneading-trough, the only thing their parents had left behind, which his brothers had not bothered with.  His brothers got places under the coachman and gardener at the royal castle, and he got one in the kitchen.
He did so much better than they did that they became envious and told the coachman that he had said he could get for the king seven silver ducks that belonged to a troll, and which the king had long desired.  The coachman told the king.  When the king insisted that he do it, he demanded wheat and rye, rowed over the lake, in the kneading trough, to the troll's place, and lured the ducks into the trough using the grain.
Then his brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's bed-quilt, and the coachman again told the king.  He demanded three days, and when he saw the bed-quilt being hung out to air, he stole it.  This time, the king made him his body-servant.
His brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's golden harp that made everyone who heard it glad, and the coachman again told the king.  He said he needed six days to think.  Then he rowed over, with a nail, a birch-pin, and a taper-end, and let the troll see him.  It seized him at once, and put him in a pen to fatten him.  One day he stuck out the nail instead of his finger, then the birch-pin, and finally the taper-end, at which point they concluded he was fat enough.
The troll went off to ask guests to come, and his daughter went to slaughter the youth.  He told her the knife wasn't sharp enough, sharpened it, and suggested testing it on one of her braids; when testing, he cut off her head and then he roasted half of her and boiled the other, as the troll had said he should be cooked.  He sat in the corner dressed in her clothing, and the troll ate his daughter and asked if he didn't want any.  The youth said he was too sad.  The troll told him to get the harp, and where it was.  The youth took it and set off in the kneading trough again.   The troll shouted after him, and the youth told him he had eaten his own daughter.  That made him burst, and the youth took all the troll's gold and silver, and with them won the princess's hand in marriage and half the kingdom. And then his brothers were killed by boulders when they went up a mountain."

When she returned, she saw two elves in blue petticoats cross her path.  The babies looked the same, but would not grow.  She and her husband argued about whether the children were theirs.  A wise man told her to make pottage in an eggshell, as if she intended to feed the entire troop of harvesters with it.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 327 C, the devil (witch) carries the hero home in a sack. Buttercup is so named because he is ""plump and fat, and fond of good things"".","While Buttercup's mother was baking, the dog began to bark and Buttercup saw an evil witch coming. His mother had him hide under the kneading trough, but the witch said she had a silver knife to give him and this lured him out. The witch told him that he had to climb into her sack to get it and, as soon as he was in, she carried him off. On the way, the witch asked ""How far is it to Snoring?"" and Buttercup said half a mile, so she rested and, using the knife, he escaped, putting a big fir root in the sack.
The next day, the witch lured him out again with the offer of a silver spoon, but he escaped in the same way, using a stone. The third day, she offered him a silver fork and went straight home without resting. She gave him to her daughter to kill. The witch's daughter did not know how to do it.

catskin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskin,Catskin,"Catskin is an English fairy tale collected by Joseph Jacobs, in More English Fairy Tales.  Marian Roalfe Cox, in her pioneering study of Cinderella, identified as one of the basic types, the Unnatural Father, contrasting with Cinderella itself and Cap O' Rushes.It is Aarne–Thompson type 510B, unnatural love.  Others of this type include Little Cat Skin, Cap O' Rushes, Donkeyskin, Allerleirauh, The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter, The She-Bear, Mossycoat, Tattercoats, The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress, and The Bear.  Indeed, some translators of Allerleirauh titled that story Catskin despite the differences between the German and English tales.

","There once was a lord who had many fine estates and who wished to leave them to a son. When a daughter is born to him instead, he is very unhappy and will not even look at her.
When she is fifteen, her father is willing to marry her off to the first man who offers.  When she hates the first man who offers, she goes to a hen-wife, who advises her to demand a coat of silver cloth before the wedding.  When her father and suitor provide that, the hen-wife advises a coat of beaten gold, and then a coat made from feathers of all the birds, and then a little coat of catskin.
The daughter puts on the Catskin coat and runs away, disguising herself as a peasant girl.  She finds a place as a scullion at a castle and works in the kitchens.
When a ball is held at the castle, the daughter, called ""Catskin"" by the others in the kitchen, asks to be allowed to attend.  The cook is amused at her request and throws a basin of water in her face, but Catskin bathes and dresses herself in the coat of silver cloth, and goes to the ball.  The young lord falls in love with her, but when he asks where she came from, she only replies from the Sign of the Basin of Water.
The young lord holds another ball, in hopes she will attend.  The cook breaks a ladle across Catskin's back when she says she would like to go, but Catskin goes in her coat of beaten gold, and when the lord again asks where she is from, Catskin replies that she came from the Sign of the Broken Ladle.
The young lord holds a third ball.  The cook breaks a skimmer across Catskin's back when she asks permission to attend, but Catskin goes in her coat of feathers, and says she came from the Sign of the Broken Skimmer.  The young lord follows her, and sees her change into her catskin coat.
The young lord goes to his mother and announces that he will marry Catskin.  His mother is opposed, and the young lord, so distraught, takes ill. His mother then agrees to the marriage.  When Catskin appears before her in the coat of gold, the mother says she is glad her daughter-in-law is so beautiful.
Soon, Catskin gives birth to a son.  One day, a beggar woman appears with her child, and Catskin sends her son to give them money.  The cook says that beggars' brats will get along, and Catskin goes to her husband and begs him to discover what happened to her parents.
Her husband finds her father, who never had another child and lost his wife, and asks him whether he had a daughter.  Catskin's father tells the lord that he had a daughter, and says that he would give all that he owns to see her again.  Catskin's husband takes her father to see his daughter and then brings him to stay with them at the castle.
In some versions of the tale, Catskin asks to simply see the ball or serve the food, and not actually attend it."
childe_rowland,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Rowland,Childe Rowland,"Childe Rowland is a fairy tale, the most popular version written by Joseph Jacobs in his English Fairy Tales, published in 1890, based on an earlier version published in 1814 by Robert Jamieson. Jamieson's was repeating a ""Scottish ballad"", which he had heard from a tailor.
Joseph Jacobs called the King of Elfland's palace ""the Dark Tower"" in his version, an addition he made that was not part of the original ballad. 
This harks to Shakespeare's King Lear and Robert Browning's poem ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"".","The story tells of how the four children of the Queen (by some accounts Guinevere), Childe Rowland, his two older brothers, and his sister, Burd Ellen, were playing ball near a church. Rowland kicked the ball over the church and Burd Ellen went to retrieve it, inadvertently circling the church ""widdershins"", or opposite the way of the sun, and disappeared. Rowland went to Merlin to ask what became of his sister and was told that she was taken to the Dark Tower by the King of Elfland, and only the boldest knight in Christendom could retrieve her.
The eldest brother decided he would make the journey, and was told what to do by Merlin. He did not return, and the middle brother followed, only to meet the same fate. Finally Childe Rowland went forth, having been given his father's sword, which never struck in vain, for protection. Merlin gave him his orders: he must chop off the head of anyone in Elfland who speaks to him until he sees his sister, and he must not eat or drink anything while in that realm. Rowland obeyed the orders, dispatching a horseherd, a cowherd, and a henwife, who would not tell him where his sister was. The henwife would only say he had to circle a hill three times widdershins, and say each time ""Open, door! open, door! And let me come in."" Following the instructions, a door opened in the hill and Rowland entered a great hall, where sat Burd Ellen, under the spell of the King of Elfland. She told him he should not have entered Elfland, for misfortune befell all who did, including their brothers, who were prisoners in the Dark Tower, nearly dead.
Rowland, forgetting Merlin's words, was overcome with hunger and asked his sister for food. Unable to warn him, she complied. At the last moment, Merlin's words returned to Rowland and he threw down the food, upon which the King of Elfland burst into the hall. Rowland fought with the King, and with the aid of his father's sword beat him into submission. The King begged for mercy, and Rowland granted it, provided his siblings were released. They returned home together, and Burd Ellen never circled the church widdershins again.
In the version given by F. A. Steel in her English Fairy Tales, originally published in 1918 (republished by Macmillan in 2016), when Rowland finds Burd Helen, or at least an enchanted version of her, and she speaks to him, he remembers Merlin's instructions and cuts her head off, which brings back the real Burd Helen. This explains why the first two brothers had not returned; they could not bring themselves to cut off her head, and had become enchanted themselves."
cinderella,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella,Cinderella,"""Cinderella"", or ""The Little Glass Slipper"", is a folk tale with thousands of variants throughout the world. The protagonist is a young woman living in forsaken circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune, with her ascension to the throne via marriage. The story of Rhodopis, recounted by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between around 7 BC and AD 23, about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story.The first literary European version of the story was published in Italy by Giambattista Basile in his Pentamerone in 1634; the version that is now most widely known in the English-speaking world was published in French by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697. Another version was later published by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1812.
Although the story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name. The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean one whose attributes were unrecognized: one who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect. The still-popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements, allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media.","A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname ""Aschenputtel"" (""Ashfool""). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and regularly visits her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.

One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.

The king decides to proclaim a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in that country to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.

The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, claiming her as his dance partner whenever a gentleman asks for her hand, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside the estate's pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped from the back, to the graveyard to the hazel tree to return her fine clothes. The father finds her asleep in the kitchen hearth, and suspects nothing. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince again dances with her the whole day, and when dark came, the prince accompanies her home. However, she climbs a pear tree in the back garden to escape him. The prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel was already in the kitchen when the father arrives home. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel, in her haste to elude the prince, loses one of her golden slippers on that pitch. The prince picks the slipper and proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.

The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. Since she will have no more need to go on foot when she will be queen, the sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two magic doves from heaven tell the prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that his dead wife left a ""dirty little Cinderella"" in the house, omitting to mention that she is his own daughter, and that she is too filthy to be seen, but the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing clean her face and hands, and when she puts on the slipper, which fitted her like a glove, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the festival, even before trying it. To the stepmother and the two limping sisters horror, their merely servant-girl had won without any subterfuge. Both the parents and the two sisters would have killed Aschenputtel, but the prince put her before him on his horse and rode off to the palace. While passing the hazel tree the two magic doves from heaven declare Aschenputtel as the true bride of the prince, and remained on her shoulders, one on the left and the other on the right.

In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's royal wedding, the false stepsisters had hoped to worm their way into her favour as the future queen, but this time they don't escape their princess' silent rage, which she kept to herself until that day, by not killing them. As she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, Aschenputtel's doves fly off her shoulders and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. It is their last chance of redemption, but since they are desperate to win the new princess' affections, they don't give up and go through the ceremony, so when the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her beloved prince march out of the church, her doves fly again, promptly striking the remaining eyes of the two evil stepsisters blind, a truly awful comeuppance they have to endure. Then, finally free from abuse and enslavement, Aschenputtel leaves her family forever to be a princess with her beloved prince, while the stepsisters live their lives as blind beggars, as her father and stepmother are in total disgrace."
clever_maria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Maria,Clever Maria,"Clever Maria is a Portuguese fairy tale.  Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.

","A merchant had three daughters, and the youngest, Maria, was the most beautiful. The merchant gave each daughter a pot of basil and forbade them to receive visitors. One day, the king came with two friends. Maria said she and her sisters would get wine from the cellar. The king said they were not thirsty. The sisters said they would not go. Maria said she would go just the same. Then she ran to a neighbour's and stayed there the night. The king was angry, but her basil did not wither, as her sisters' did.

The daughters looked over at the king's garden, and the oldest daughter asked Maria to climb down a rope and steal some fruit for her. A gardener caught her, but she escaped. The next day, the second daughter asked her to steal a fruit basket for her, but this time the king caught her. He questioned her, she denied nothing, and he told her to follow him to the house. Though he turned to make sure she followed him, she managed to escape. He fell ill.

Meanwhile, her two sisters had married the king's friends and had babies. Maria took the babies to show the king. Maria went about, calling for someone to give the babies to the king, who was sick of love. The king bought it and was infuriated that he held the babies. He knew the merchant had returned and ordered him to bring him a coat of stone or lose his head. Maria told him to take the fabric to the castle and demanded to measure the king. The king changed his order: he had to bring not the coat but his daughter Maria. Maria told her father to make her a doll of herself, with strings so she could make it nod and shake its head. Maria went to the castle and hid behind the doll. When the king recounted her misdeeds, she made the doll nod. Because she was mocking him, he cut off the doll's head. Its head fell toward him, and he said that the man who killed her deserved to die and turned the sword on himself. Maria jumped out to stop him. They married and lived happily."
corvetto__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvetto_(fairy_tale),Corvetto (fairy tale),"""Corvetto"" is an Italian literary fairy tale written by Giambattista Basile in his 1634 work, the ""Pentamerone"".It is Aarne-Thompson type 531.  Other tales of this type include ""The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa"", ""Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful"", ""King Fortunatus's Golden Wig"", and ""The Mermaid and the Boy"".  Another, literary variant is Madame d'Aulnoy's ""La Belle aux cheveux d'or"", or ""The Story of Pretty Goldilocks"".

","Corvetto served a king loyally and was favored by him.  Envious fellow servants tried to slander him, but failed. An ogre lived nearby, with a magnificent horse, and finally the servants said that the king should send Corvetto to steal it.  Corvetto went, and jumped on the horse.  It shouted to its master, who chased after with wild animals (one of them being a Werewolf), but Corvetto rode it off.  The king was even more pleased, and the other servants told him to send Corvetto after the ogre's tapestry.  Corvetto went, hid under the ogres' bed, and in the night stole both the tapestries and the counterpane from the bed (causing the ogre and ogress to argue about who hogged them).  He dropped them from a window and fled back to the king.
The servants then persuaded him to send Corvetto for the entire palace.  He went and talked with the ogress, offering to help her.  She asked him to split wood for her.  He used the axe on her neck.  Then he dug a deep pit in the doorway and covered it.  He lured the ogre and his friends into it, stoned them to death, and gave the king the palace."
costanza___costanzo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costanza_/_Costanzo,Costanza / Costanzo,"Costanza / Costanzo is an Italian literary fairy tale written by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola (written between 1550 and 1555).

","A king married to have heirs, and his wife bore three daughters.  In time, he realized that his wife had come to an age where she would have no more children, and his three daughters were ready for marriage.  He married them off and split his kingdom between them, keeping only enough land to support his court.  
A few years later, the queen gave birth to a fourth daughter, Costanza.  Costanza was raised well and became a gracious, educated and accomplished princess.  When she was old enough to marry, they proposed that she marry the son of a marquis, because her dowry would not be enough for a match equal to her birth.  Costanza refused to marry below her station, dressed as a man, and left, calling herself Costanzo.  
She entered a king's service, where the queen desired her as a lover, but ""Costanzo"" rejected her.  The king had long wished to have as a captive one of the satyrs that did great damage in his land; the queen suggested to him that so good a servant as Costanzo could catch one. The king proposed it to Costanzo, who agreed to please him.  She asked for a large vessel, wine, and bread.  In the woods, she filled the vessel with the wine and bread and climbed a tree.  The satyrs smelled it, ate the bread, and fell asleep.  Costanza tied up one and carried him off.  On the way back, the satyr woke and began to laugh:  at a funeral of a child, at a hanging, at a crowd that hailed her as ""Costanzo"", and at being presented to the king.
The king tried to make the satyr talk.  The queen said that Costanzo could certainly make it talk.  Costanzo tried to bribe it with food, then threatened it with hunger, and finally promised to free it.  It ate and talked.  It told that at the funeral, the apparent father was not the father, but the priest was; at the hanging, the crowd was filled with officials who pilfered far more money than the thief to be hanged; and that it would explain the rest the next day. The next day, it explained that they were hailing her by the wrong name, and that the king was deluded into believing his wife's maidens were women, when they were disguised men. The king had his queen and her disguised lovers burned, and married Costanza."
culhwch_and_olwen,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen,Culhwch and Olwen,"Culhwch and Olwen (Welsh: Culhwch ac Olwen) is a Welsh tale that survives in only two manuscripts about a hero connected with Arthur and his warriors: a complete version in the Red Book of Hergest, c. 1400, and a fragmented version in the White Book of Rhydderch, c. 1325. It is the longest of the surviving Welsh prose tales.

","Culhwch's father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother's attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden Pencawr. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall.

Arthur agrees to lend help in whatever capacity Culhwch asks, save the lending of his sword Caledfwlch and other named armaments, or his wife. He sends not only six of his finest warriors (Cai, Bedwyr, Gwalchmei, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Menw son of Tairgwaedd, Cynddylig Gyfarwydd), but a huge list of personages of various skills (including Gwynn ap Nudd) recruited to join Culhwch in his search for Olwen. The group meets some relatives of Culhwch's that know Olwen and agree to arrange a meeting. Olwen is receptive to Culhwch's attraction, but she cannot marry him unless her father Ysbaddaden ""Chief Giant"" agrees, and he, unable to survive past his daughter's wedding, will not consent until Culhwch completes a series of about forty impossible-sounding tasks, including the obtaining of the basket/hamper of Gwyddneu Garanhir, the hunt of Ysgithyrwyn chief boar. The completion of only a few of these tasks is recorded and the giant is killed, leaving Olwen free to marry her lover."
dapplegrim,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapplegrim,Dapplegrim,"Dapplegrim (Grimsborken) is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in their Norske Folkeeventyr.  Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A man, the youngest of 12 children, decides to wander off from his rich parents' house. Upon his return, he finds his parents have died and his brothers have shared all the lands among themselves, thinking he was dead. They offer him 12 mares as compensation, and when he goes to check them he finds all of them have a foal, and that one has yet another foal, a very sleek dapple-gray one. When he praises the beauty of the foal, it replies back and tells him that he'll be more splendid if the young man would go and kill all the other foals and let him feed on all the mares' milk for a year. The young man decides to heed to this advice and finds him a year later being quite large and sleeker. The colt tells him that he would be even more splendid if the young man were to go again and kill the 12 foals that have been born since, which the young man agrees to do. Yet again he returns the next year, finding the horse being huge an incredibly sleek, and yet again the horse asks him to kill the new foals and let him have the mares' milk for one more year, to which the young man agrees again. At last, he returns a year later to find the horse impossibly large and radiant, and the horse decides then to go with him.
The brothers are surprised that he has such a horse, and on the horse advice, they give him horseshoes and a golden saddle and a golden bridle, in exchange for the 12 mares and their new foals. Then, the man rides the horse, whose name is Dapplegrim, to the kingdom's capital. The king's daughter had been kidnapped by a troll and the king had promised her hand and half his kingdom to whomever could rescue her. Dapplegrim promises the man that he'll help, but the man needs to request the best food and stables for the horse. The king, upon seeing the man riding in such superb horse agrees. Envious knights urge the king to send the man to rescue the princess or else he should be killed, to which the man reluctantly agrees. Dapplegrim asks him to request for iron and silver horseshoes, and after obtaining them takes him to the troll's cave on top of an almost vertical stone wall on a hill, and manages to ride up, the man putting the princess on top of the horse before the troll can even stand up.
Upon his triumphant return with the princess, however, the ill-advised king asks him that in order to marry the princess he needs to get rid of the ridge that prevents the sun to shine in his hall. Dapplegrim again says he can help, but the man needs to request even heavier silver and iron horseshoes. Then the horse jumps on top of the ridge until it finally sinks. Once again, however, the king asks something else: the man needs to procure an equally splendid horse for the bride, or else he will be killed. Dapplegrim agrees to help again, and this time demands for even larger horseshoes, as well as an assortment of things, for they must go to hell where another horse like it lies. After a number of adventures, Dapplegrim fights the hellish horse and defeats it, at which point the man puts the bridle on it and they return together, the second horse happening to be identical to Dapplegrim in every single detail.
Yet, the king has still one more trial for the man: the princess must hide twice and be found, and then the man must hide twice and the princess be unable to find him. The princess transforms first into a duck, and then into a loaf of bread, but on both occasions Dapplegrim told the man, so he finds her. When it is his turn, the man, transforms into a tick and hides in Dapplegrim's nostril, and the second time into a clump of dirt hiding in between the horse's hooves and its horseshoes. The princess is unable to find him, due to Dapplegrim not allowing her to come close. At last, the man and the princess ride in their horses to the church to get married."

dick_whittington_and_his_cat,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Whittington_and_His_Cat,Dick Whittington and His Cat,"Dick Whittington and His Cat is the English folklore surrounding the real-life Richard Whittington (c. 1354–1423), wealthy merchant and later Lord Mayor of London. The legend describes his rise from poverty-stricken childhood with the fortune he made through the sale of his cat to a rat-infested country. However, the real Whittington did not come from a poor family of common stock, and there is no compelling evidence supporting the stories about the cat, or even whether he owned one.
Another element in the legend is that Dick attempted to flee his service as a scullion one night, heading towards home (or reached Highgate Hill in later tradition), but was dissuaded by the sound of Bow bells, which promised he would be mayor of London one day.
Since the pre-Victorian era, the story has been a favourite subject of British pantomime, especially during Christmas season.","The following summary gives a comparison of three textual sources. B = Johnson's ballad, H = prose by Heywood, signed T. H. (Wheatley ed.); C = Late chapbook (18th to 19th-century printing by J. Cheney):
To LondonDick Whittington was a poor orphan boy, languishing in Lancashire (B), or some unnamed place in the country (H, C). He set off to seek his fortune in London (B, H, C), enticed by the rumour that its streets were paved with gold (C). But he soon found himself cold and hungry, and fell asleep at the gate of the home of a wealthy merchant named Fitzwarren (H, C). Fitzwarren gave him lodging and hired him to be the scullion in the kitchen (B, H, C).

Dick and his catIn the prose versions, an account of Dick Whittington's cat subsequently follows, but in the ballad, it is preceded by Dick's flight and church bells episode.
In the prose legend, Dick is provided quarter at the Fitzwarrens' garret (room in the attic) (H, C), which was infested with rats and mice (H, C). But Dick owned a cat (B, H, C), that the prose versions say he had bought for a penny he earned by shining shoes (H, C). The cat controlled his rodent problem, which made her an indispensable companion.
When Fitzwarren organized a trade expedition sending the merchant ship Unicorn (H), Dick's cat was ""ventured"" to this mission to be sold for profit abroad (B, H, C). The versions also differ regarding the circumstances: either Dick relinquished the cat of his own volition, hoping its sale in a foreign land might reap a ""store of gold"" towards the fulfillment of the omen of the bells (B), or, Dick was compelled to do so by Fitzwarren, who maintained a steadfast rule that everyone in his household should have some article of worth riding on the venture, with due dividends forthcoming from the proceeds (H, C).

Flight, and the bells tollingDick became disenchanted with the scullion's lot and attempted to flee, either because he received only room and board for his labours but was denied monetary wages (B), or because the kitchen maid (H) or female cook named Mrs. Cicely (C) abused and physically beat him beyond his tolerance. He ran as far away as Bunhill (H) or Holloway (C), where he heard ""London Bells"" (B), Bow bells (C), or the bells of ""Bow Church"" (H), that seemed to be telling him,  

which persuaded him to retrace his steps. (The wording of the bells' message differ slightly according to the textual source).

Rags to richesThe ship was driven off course to the Barbary Coast, where the Moorish king purchased the entire cargo for a load of gold, and insisted on entertaining the English traders with a feast. But the banquet was swarmed with rats and mice, whereby the English ""factor"" (business agent) informed their hosts that they were in possession of a creature which could exterminate these vermin (H, C). Thus Dick Whittington's cat was immediately put to the test, chasing and destroying the rodents. The Moors, even more pleased to learn that the cat was pregnant, paid more (H) (or ten times more (C)) for the cat than the rest of the cargo combined.
The ship returned to London and Fitzwarren who was apprised of the success of the venture (at his home on Leadenhall (H)), summoned the besmirched scullion Dick Whittington to the parlour (H) (or compting-room (C)) and sat him in a seat, addressing him in dignified fashion as Master (H) or Mr. Whittington. Dick was upset at first that this was being done in mockery, but Fitzwarren insisted it was all in earnest, explaining that the profits from the ship now made Dick a richer man than himself (C, H).
Dick married his former master's daughter Alice Fitzwarren (C, H), and joined his father-in-law in his business (H). In time, Whittington became the Lord Mayor of London three times, just as the bells had predicted. Whittington's acts of charity included the building of a college, a church (B, H, C), and Newgate Prison (B, H, C). He also burnt the bonds he owned, which the Crown had issued to fund the war (B, H)."

","A peasant named Crabbe saw how well a doctor ate and asked him how to become one. The doctor told him to buy an ABC book with a rooster up front, sell his oxen and cart to buy doctor's equipment and clothing, and advertise himself as ""Doctor Know-all."" Crabbe takes this advice serious and soon becomes a doctor under this name.
Shortly after he set himself up, a nobleman visited him and asked to find stolen money. Crabbe insists that his wife should come along. At the nobleman's home Crabbe and his wife are invited for dinner. When they sat to eat, Crabbe nudged his wife at each course, saying ""That's one,"" ""That's two,"" and ""That's three"" – meaning three courses. However, the servants who brought the dishes and who'd actually stolen the money thought he was identifying them. The fourth servant then brought the final meal under a covered tray. The lord asked the doctor to show his all-knowing skill and guess what was underneath the tray. Crabbe, who had no idea, pitied himself and cried: ""Ah, poor Crabbe!"" As it happens the meal was indeed a plate full of crabs.
All four servants were now in complete panic. They asked Crabbe to speak to him confidently and confessed their crime. If he would not denounce them they would willingly restore the money and give him part of the finders' reward. Crabbe agreed and was shown where the loot was hidden. He then went back to the nobleman, sat down to the table and pretended to look for the answer in his ABC book. Meanwhile, a fifth servant was hiding inside a stove to listen if Doctor Know-all still knew more. When Crabbe tried to look up the answer he said: ""I know you are there, so you better show yourself!"" The servant inside the stove thought Crabbe meant him and jumped out the stove. Then Crabbe revealed where the money was and received a lot of money both from the nobleman as well as from the frightened servants, becoming a wealthy and renowned man."

It was likely an offspring from the tale of ""Cupid and Psyche"" in The Golden Ass, which gave rise to similar animal bridegroom cycles such as ""Beauty and the Beast"".It was included by Andrew Lang in The Blue Fairy Book (1890).

","The White Bear approaches a poor peasant and asks if he will give him his prettiest and youngest daughter; in return, the bear will make the man rich.  The girl is reluctant, so the peasant asks the bear to return, and in the meantime, persuades her to marry the bear.  The White Bear takes her off to a magnificent enchanted castle.  At night, he discards his bear form, and comes to her bed as a man. She never sees him, however, because he enters her bedroom after she extinguishes the light, and leaves before daybreak.

When she grows homesick, the bear agrees that she might go home as long as she agrees that she will never speak with her mother alone, but only when other people are around.  At home, her family welcomes her, and her mother makes persistent attempts to speak with her alone. She finally persuades her daughter to disclose the entire account about the stranger man who sleeps beside her in the dark each night, and leaves before daybreak. In response to the girl's story, she insists that the White Bear must really be a troll, gives her a candle, and tells her to light it at night, to see who is sharing her bed, warning her not to spill any tallow.

The girl obeys, and discovers that the bear is actually a highly attractive prince. Falling in love with him at first sight, she kisses him, and spills three drops of tallow on him. Waking him, thus, she is told that if she had waited for a year, he would have been free, but now he must go to his wicked stepmother, who turned him into his form and lives in a castle that lies east of the Sun and west of the Moon, and marry her hideous daughter, a troll princess.
In the morning, the girl finds that the palace has vanished.  She sets out in search of the prince.  Coming to a great mountain, she finds an old woman playing with a golden apple.  She asks the old woman if she knows the way to the castle that lies east of the Sun and west of the Moon.  The old woman cannot tell her the way, but lends her a horse to ride to a neighbor who might be able to, and gives her the apple.  The neighbor is sitting outside another mountain, with a golden carding comb.  She, also, does not know the way to the castle, but lends the girl another horse to ride to another neighbor who might know, and gives her the carding comb.  That third old woman does not know the way to the castle either, but lends the girl another horse to ride to the East Wind, and gives her the golden spinning wheel with which she had been working.
The East Wind has never been to the castle that lies east of the Sun and west of the Moon, but believes his stronger brother, the West Wind might have been there. He takes her to the West Wind, who brings her to the South Wind for the same reason. The South Wind brings her to the North Wind, again, for the same reason. The North Wind says he once exhausted himself blowing an aspen leaf to her desired destination, but would take her there if she was absolutely determined to go there. The girl says she is determined to go there, and so, he takes her there.

The morning after her arrival at the castle, the girl starts to play with the golden apple. The troll princess, who is betrothed to the prince, sees the golden plaything, and says to the girl that she would like to buy it. The girl agrees to part with it in exchange for a night with the prince. The troll princess agrees to the exchange, but gives the prince a sleeping drink, so that he cannot be woken up. These events recur the next night, after the girl gives the troll princess the gold carding comb.  This time, the girl's weeping and plaintive utterances, as she attempts to awaken the prince, are overheard by imprisoned townspeople within the castle. They report to him what they had overheard. On the third day, the troll princess agrees to another night in the prince's bedchamber in exchange for the girl's golden spinning wheel. That night, the prince does not drink the potion that the troll princess brings him, and so, he is awake for the girl's visit.
The prince tells her how she can save him:  He will declare that he will marry anyone who can wash out the tallow stains from his shirt, since trolls, like his stepmother and her daughter, the troll princess, cannot do it. He would call on the girl for this purpose. When she succeeds, he would claim her for his bride. The plan works out, and rage causes the trolls to explode. The spell is broken, and the prince no longer needs to assume his bear form during the day. He and his bride free the prisoners within the castle that lies east of the Sun and west of the Moon, and leave it far behind them with all the gold and silver that had been housed within it."

Other tales of this type include Cinderella, Finette Cendron, The Golden Slipper, Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, The Sharp Grey Sheep, The Story of Tam and Cam, and The Wonderful Birch.

","King Hugh Cùrucha had three daughters:  Fair, Brown and Trembling. Since Trembling was the most beautiful, her older sisters made her stay at home, for fear that she would marry before them.  After seven years, the son of the king of Emania fell in love with Fair.  A henwife told Trembling she should go to church; when she objected that she had no suitable dress, the henwife gave her one, a horse, a honey-finger, and a honey-bird and told her to leave as soon as Mass was done.  She obeyed, and got away before any man came near her.  After two more times, the son of the king of Emania forgot Fair for the woman who had come to church and ran after her, managing to get her shoe when she rode off.
The king's son looked for the woman whose foot the shoe fit, although the other king's sons warned him that he would have to fight them for her.  They searched all over, and when they came to the house, they insisted on trying Trembling as well.  The king's son said at once that she was the woman; Trembling went off and reappeared in the clothing she had worn to church, and everyone else agreed.
The sons of foreign kings fought him for her, but the king's son defeated them all, and the Irish king's sons said they would not fight one of their own.  So the king's son and Trembling got married.  Trembling had a son, and her husband sent for Fair to help her.  One day, when they walked by the seashore, Fair pushed Trembling in.  A whale swallowed Trembling, and Fair passed herself off as her sister.

Once he spent it all paying off a dead man's debts, so he could be buried, and another time, he bought a slave woman, the Sultan's kidnapped daughter, and married her.  His father beat them both and drove them out of his home.  The wife said that she would paint, and her husband would sell the paintings, though he must not tell where they came from.  Turks saw them, recognized the work, and told him they wanted more.  He said to come to his house, where his wife painted them, and they seized her and carried her off.
He walked on the shore, and an old man agreed to have him fish with him.  They were captured by Turks and sold to the Sultan as slaves.  The old man was made a gardener, and the young man to carry bouquets to the Sultan's daughter, whom the Sultan had imprisoned in a tower as punishment.  One day his wife recognized him while he was singing.  They escaped with a great deal of treasure.
The old man said that they must divide the treasure.  The young man offered him half.  When the old man asked if his wife was also half his, the young man offered him three quarters.  The old man told him that he was the dead man whose debts he had paid, and vanished.  The young man was reconciled with his father, who died not long after, leaving him all his wealth."

James Planché included it in Four and twenty tales, selected from those of Perrault and other popular writers.

","A King and a Queen, who have several children, decide to journey across their Kingdom. One day, they stop in a castle at the frontier and the Queen gives birth to a beautiful princess. Because of this, the courtiers name her Fairer-than-a-Fairy. But no sooner has the Queen recovered that she must join the King, who has gone to defend a faraway province attacked by their enemies.
When Fairer-than-a-Fairy is twelve, her beauty becomes famous in all the surrounding countries. The Fairies become jealous of her beauty and her name and decide to avenge themselves and destroy the Princess’ beauty. The Queen of the Fairies, named Nabote, goes to the castle in order to kidnap Fairer-than-a-Fairy but she finds it impossible, because the wizard who built it put a spell so that its inhabitants could neither go out unwillingly, nor be bewitched.
Nabote goes into the castle as a servant and makes friends with Fairer-than-a-Fairy. One day, she opens a door that gives onto the countryside and pretends to faint outside the castle's walls. Fairer-than-a-Fairy runs to her but no sooner has she gone out that Nabote seizes her and takes her to her Kingdom. There she dresses Fairer-than-a-Fairy with dirty clothes and instructs her to clean a room which will only become dirtier as she sweeps it.
Nabote's son, Phratis, professes his love for her and magically cleans the room. He gives Fairer-than-a-Fairy a key and tells her to open the main panel in her cell. She obeys and meets Désirs, another princess who was kidnapped because she was beautiful without the assistance of the Fairies’ gifts.
When the Fairies find that the two princesses have fulfilled the tasks, they order Fairer-than-a-Fairy to go on Mount Adventurous and fill a vase with the Water of Immortal Life. They give her feathers and wax, hoping she will crash like Icarus. Désirs is sent on the beach and ordered to write something on the sand on condition that it will not fade. Phratis helps Fairer-than-a-Fairy and she asks him to complete Désirs’ task.
Finally, Fairer-than-a-Fairy is instructed to capture the Hind with Silver Feet and Désirs is sent to the Fair of Time in order to fetch the Rouge of Youth.
At the fair, Désirs meets a wicked Fairy who keeps her in a prison and sends for an evil spirit in order to make her ugly. Désirs is rescued by her lover who has been instructed by a sage to bring her back to the Queen of the Fairies.
Meanwhile, with the help of Phratis, Fairer-than-a-Fairy finds the Hind, who is revealed to be the former Queen of the Fairies under an enchantment. The Queen and Fairer-than-a-Fairy return to Nabote's court, where they save Désirs from being executed, and Désirs’ lover is revealed to be Fairer-than-a-Fairy's brother.
The former Queen retakes her throne, sends Nabote to another kingdom, and arranges the marriages of the two couples."
fairer_than_a_fairy__mailly_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairer-than-a-Fairy_(Mailly),Fairer-than-a-Fairy (Mailly),"Fairer-than-a-Fairy (French: Le Prince Arc-en-ciel, English: ""The Rainbow Prince"") is a literary fairy tale published anonymously in the 1718 fairy tale collection Nouveaux contes de fées. It is attributed to the Chevalier de Mailly. Andrew Lang included it in The Yellow Fairy Book.

","After many childless years, a king had a daughter so beautiful that he named her ""Fairer-than-a-Fairy"".  This enraged the fairies, who resolved to kidnap her.  They entrusted this to the oldest fairy, Lagrée, who had only one eye and one tooth left and could preserve those only by soaking them in a magical liquid at night.  She kidnapped the seven-year-old princess, whose cat and dog followed her, and brought her to a castle, where she had a pretty room but was charged to never let a fire go out and to take care of two glass bottles.

One day, while she wandered in the garden, sunlight struck a fountain, and she heard a voice telling her that he was a prince held prisoner here, and he had fallen in love with her; he could speak only in the form of a rainbow, when sunlight shone on that fountain.  They talked when they could, which one day led to her allowing the fire to go out.  Lagrée, delighted, ordered Fairer-than-a-Fairy to get a new fire from Locrinos, a cruel monster that ate whoever it found, especially young girls.  On the way, a bird told her to pick up a shining pebble, and she did.  She reached Locrinos's house; only his wife was home, and she was impressed by her manners and beauty, and still more by the stone, and so she gave her the fire and another stone.
The princess was able to meet her lover again, and they devised a way, by putting a crystal bowl on her windowsill, that they could meet more readily.  One day, the prince appeared, woeful; he had just learned that his prison was to be changed.  The next day, it was cloudy all day until the very end.  In her haste to reach him, Fairer-than-a-Fairy upset the bowl.  Rather than lose the chance to speak with him, she filled it with the water from the two bottles.  Then she set out with her dog and cat, a sprig of myrtle, and the stone Locrinos's wife had given her.  Lagrée followed her.  When Fairer-than-a-Fairy slept in the shelter that the stone made, Lagrée caught up, but the dog bit her, making her fall and break her last tooth.  While she raged, Fairer-than-a-Fairy escaped and went on.  She slept under a myrtle that sprang up from the sprig, and when Lagrée reached her, the cat scratched her eye out, making the fairy helpless against her.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy went on.  Each night, for three nights, she found a green and white house, where a woman in green and white gave her a nut, a golden pomegranate, and a crystal smelling-bottle, to open at her greatest need.  After that, she came to a silver castle, without doors or windows, suspended by silver chains from trees.  She wanted to get into it and cracked the nut.  She found in it a tiny hall porter, with a key.  She climbed one of the chains and the porter let her in a secret door.  She found the Rainbow Prince there, asleep.  She told her story, twenty times, loudly, without waking him.  She opened the pomegranate, where violins flew out of the seeds and began to play, waking him, but not entirely.  Fairer-than-a-Fairy opened the bottle, where a siren flew out and told him his lady's story, rousing him.  The castle walls opened up, and a court assembled about them, with the prince's mother, who informed him that his father was dead and he was now king.  The three green and white ladies appeared and revealed Fairer-than-a-Fairy's royal birth.  The prince and she married."
fairy_ointment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Ointment,Fairy Ointment,"Fairy Ointment or ""The Fairy Nurse"" is an English fairy tale collected by Joseph Jacobs in his English Fairy Tales.  It has been told in many variants.  Andrew Lang included one in The Lilac Fairy Book.
The ointment itself, as a substance allowing a human to see fairies, occasionally appears in fantasy literature.  Folk-tales about such an ointment are found in Scandinavia, France and the British Isles

","A midwife is summoned to attend a childbed. The baby is born, and she is given an ointment to rub in its eyes. Accidentally, or through curiosity, she rubs one or both her own eyes with it. This enables her to see the actual house to which she has been summoned. Sometimes a simple cottage becomes a castle, but most often, a grand castle becomes a wretched cave.
In the variant Andrew Lang included, the woman saw a neighbor of hers, kept prisoner as a nurse, and was able to tell her husband how to rescue her, pulling her down from riding fairies as in Tam Lin.
Soon, the midwife sees a fairy and admits it. The fairy invariably blinds her in the eye that can see him, or both if she put the ointment in both eyes.
In a Cornish tale a woman, Joan, is going to market to buy shoes, and calls on a neighbour, Betty, who has a reputation for witchcraft, to see if she will go along. Joan sees Betty rub an ointment into her children's eyes. When Betty is out of the room she rubs some of the ointment into right eye out of curiosity. Betty returns with a glass of brandy, and when Joan drinks the brandy she is amazed to see that the cottage is full of little people dancing and playing games. Betty says she won't go to market, so Joan goes alone.
At the market, Joan sees Betty's husband, Thomas Trenance, taking ""whatever took his fancy"" from the market stalls and putting it into a bag, apparently unnoticed by the stall holders.  She challenges him as a thief. He asks which eye she sees him with, and when she points to her right eye he touches it with his finger and she is instantly blinded."

Finally, a driver, Farmer Weathersky, accepted the boy and told him to get on his sleigh, whereupon it flew off into the air. When the farmer told his wife what had happened she sent him off to look for the boy.
He found a hag in the forest, and she consulted all the animals and was unable to tell him where to find Farmer Weathersky.  She sent him to her sister, who unsuccessfully consulted all the fish and sent him on to the third sister, who consulted all the birds and found an eagle who could help him.  The eagle sent him in to steal three crumbs of bread, three hairs from a man who snored, who proved to be Farmer Weathersky himself, a stone, and three chips of wood, and to use the crumbs to catch a hare.
They were chased by a flock of crows, but the father threw down the hairs, and they turned to ravens that drove them off.  Then Farmer Weathersky himself came after them, and the father threw down the wood chips, which turned to a forest, and Farmer Weathersky had to go back to get his ax.  When he got through the forest, the father threw down the stone, and it turned to a mountain.  Trying to get through it, Farmer Weathersky broke his leg and had to go home.  The man took the hare to a churchyard and sprinkled the dirt over him, and the hare became his son.
When it was time for the fair, the son turned into a horse and told his father not to sell him with the headstall.  The father sells him twice, with the son escaping afterward, but third time,  Farmer Weathersky bought him and got the father so drunk he forgot to take off the headstall.
Farmer Weathersky rode him off but decided to have a drink.  So he tied up the horse with red-hot nails at its nose and a sieve of oats at its tail, but a lass saw it and released the horse.  The boy jumped into the duckpond, turning himself into a fish, and Farmer Weathersky turned into a pike.  The boy turned into a dove, and Farmer Weathersky into a hawk, but a princess saw the chase and said he should come in her window.  He told her his tale, and she had him turn into a golden ring on her finger, though he warned her that the king would fall ill, and Farmer Weathersky would cure him and demand the ring as payment; she said that she would claim the ring was from her mother.
It happened, and the king insisted on the payment, whatever the princess said.  The princess put the ring in the fireplace's ashes, and Farmer Weathersky turned into a cock to scrape among them, and the boy turned into a fox and bit off his head."

Then all it contained would be his.
When the boy was seven, all the other boys boasted of what their godfathers had given them.  Ferdinand went to his father for his gift and heard of the key, but there was no castle on the heath.  When he was fourteen, he went again, and found a castle.  Inside there was nothing but a white horse, but he took the horse home and decided to travel.

","A king and queen lost their kingdom and sold all they had brought with them, until they were poor.  The queen resolved that she could make nets, with which the king could catch birds and fish to support them.  As for their three daughters, they were useless; the king should take them somewhere and leave them there.
Their youngest, Finette, heard this and went to her fairy godmother.  She became tired on the way and sat down to cry.  A jennet appeared before her, and she begged it to carry her to her godmother.  Her godmother gave her a ball of thread that, if she tied to the house door, would lead her back, and a bag with gold and silver dresses.
The next day, their mother led them off and urged them to go to sleep in a meadow.  Then she left.  Though her sisters were cruel to her, Finette woke them.  The sisters promised her many things if she would lead them, and they made their way back.  Their mother pretended she had left to get something else.  Her sisters blamed Finette, gave her nothing they had promised, and beat her.  The queen resolved to lead them away further, so Finette visited her godmother again.  Her godmother told her this time to bring a sack of ashes and use it to make footprints, but she should not bring her sisters back, and she would never see her godmother again if she did.  The queen led them off, her sisters bewailed their fate, and Finette had pity on them.  The king and queen plotted for a third time, and the middle sister said they could leave peas for their path, but Finette brought her jewelry and the bag of clothing instead.  When the queen abandoned them, pigeons had eaten their peas, and they could not return.
Finette found an acorn and refused to let them eat it; instead, they planted it.  They ate cabbages and lettuce.  The acorn grew into a tree and Finette climbed it.  One day, her sisters looked into her bag and found her jewelry; they stole it and put stones in its place.  After this, one day Finette saw from the tree a dazzling castle.  Her sisters stole her clothing and jewelry and left her in rags when they went to it.  A hideous and enormous old woman told them that it was an ogre's castle.  She told them she would let them live a few days; they tried to flee but she caught them.  The ogre returned, and she hid them so she could eat them herself.  He smelled them, and she persuaded him to keep them to look after the castle, so she could eat them while he was gone.  While they were at work, Finette tricked the ogre into the oven and burned him to cinders.  Then she persuaded the ogress that if she let them dress her and do her hair, she would soon find a noble husband.  While she was doing the hair, she cut off the ogress's head.
Her sisters dressed themselves in the treasures of the castle and, so they might find husbands, went off to show themselves in the nearest town, threatening to beat her if the castle was not perfectly kept.  They came back with tales of dancing with the king's son and kept going and leaving her behind.  One day, Finette found an old key, and it proved to be gold and to open a chest full of beautiful clothing.  When her sisters left, she dressed herself and followed to the ball, where she called herself Cendron and everyone paid court to her.
For many days, this went on; the chest always produced new clothing.  But one day, Finette left in a hurry because she had to get back before her sisters, and she left behind a red velvet slipper, embroidered with pearls.  The king's oldest son found it and fell ill.  No doctor could cure him.  He said he had fallen in love with the woman whose shoe it was, so they ordered all the women to appear and try it on.  Her sisters went, but Finette did not know the way.  She dressed herself and found the jennet at her door again.  She rode past her sisters, splashing them with mud.  When she put on the slipper, the prince wanted to marry her, but Finette insisted that the king, who was the one who had conquered her parents' kingdom, restore it to them, first.  They agreed.  She married off her sisters and sent back to the jennet with gifts for her fairy godmother."

The oldest known tale of this type is Guerrino and the Savage Man.  Another variant is Iron John.

","In the woods near a rich lord's castle, a mysterious bird sang.  Fascinated, the lord had it captured.  It ceased to sing, but he threatened to kill anyone who freed it.  One day, it pleaded with the lord's son Georgic, who freed it; it told him to call on it, Merlin, if in need and then flew off. Georgic's mother feared that her husband would kill Georgic. A salt-vendor offered to take him away, and his mother gave him money to do it.  He took the money and at the next castle, offered the boy as a shepherd, despite the warnings of wolves that threatened. When the salt-vendor went to leave him, Georgic demanded the money and when it was refused, he called on the bird; it appeared, and a club wielded by an invisible hand struck the man until he gave the money. Then he called on the bird to give him a whistle to summon the wolves and muzzles to keep them from biting, and so he kept the sheep safe.
In the same region, there was a dragon with seven heads that had to receive a maiden every year.  That year, the lot fell to Georgic's master's daughter, who wept for fear.  When she was sent, Georgic asked the bird for a horse, a sword, and a black cloak; he took her on his horse and carried her to the place, where he called for the dragon.  It declared it was not hungry that day, she was to come back the next, and left.  Georgic carried her back; she had been too upset to recognize him, but she had cut a piece from his cloak.  She went back the next day, and this time Georgic wore a gray cloak, but the events went as before.  The third day, Georgic wore a purple cloak, and he stopped and borrowed a long iron fork that a man was using on the stove.  He used it to drag the dragon from its lair and cut off its heads with his sword.  He cut out the tongues, and the daughter cut off a piece of this cloak as well.
A coal miner claimed to have killed the dragon. The daughter said the dragon slayer had cut out the tongues, and the coal miner claimed to have eaten them. The lord held a great feast, and the daughter saw Georgic in his black cloak, which had exactly the hole in it that she had cut. Georgic vanished. The lord had a second banquet, at which Georgic wore the gray cloak, with the hole just as she had cut it; the lord asked him whether he was the one who had rescued his daughter, and he said he might be. At the third banquet, Georgic arrived in a grand manner. The daughter recognized him by the hole, and they married.
Soon after, her father fell ill.  A wizard said that he could be cured with a piece of orange from the orange tree of the Armenian Sea, water from the Fountain of Life, and some bread and wine from the Yellow Queen.  Georgic had two brothers-in-law who were jealous of him; they set out and became lost.  Georgic also set out.  In the woods, he met a hermit, who gave him a magic wand to lead him.  It would take him to the orange tree, where he should cut the orange into four parts, one of which he should take away.  Then he would reach the Fountain of Life, but he should go to the Yellow Queen's castle first, taking some wine and bread, and a lance, calling out it was for his father-in-law's health.  He would then find a stag which he should ride to the Fountain; if the lion that guarded it woke, he should use the lance to kill it.  He retrieved the things in this way.
He met his brothers-in-law along the way, and traded some of what he had won for the ear and wedding ring of one, and the toe of the other.  The hermit had warned him that he would have to give what he had taken back to the Yellow Queen after a month.  He did not warn them, and when the Yellow Queen came, he was gone, and his brothers-in-law were beaten for having it.  They had to run to him and beg his help, which he gave."

","A royal hunter shoots a bird; wounded, it begs him not to kill it but to take it home, and when it goes to sleep, strike its head.  He does so, and the bird becomes a beautiful woman.

She conjures two spirits and sets them to make a marvelous carpet.  Then she gives the carpet to her husband and tells him to accept whatever price he is given.  The merchants do not know how much to pay for it, and finally, the king's steward buys it for ten thousand rubles.  The king sees it and gives the steward twenty-five thousand for it.
The steward goes to the hunter's house to get another and sees his wife.  He falls madly in love with her, and the king sees it.  The steward tells him why, and the king goes himself and sees the hunter's wife.  He decides that he should marry her instead and demands the steward devise a way to be rid of the husband.  The steward, with a stranger's advice, has him sent to the land of the dead to ask of the former King's behavior, in the hope that he never returns. The hunter being told of this tells his wife. She gives him a magic ring and says that he must take the king's steward with him as a witness, to prove that he really has visited the Underworld. He does. After their return and seeing how the King's father was punished by the devils for his sins, the hunter thinks he fulfilled his duty, but the King becomes angry and just sends him back home. But who really gets the anger of the monarch, is the steward, who is ordered again to find another way to let the hunter disappear, or else the steward will be executed. The man asks again for advice from the stranger and he/she tells him to catch a large man-eating magical cat called Bajun who lives on an iron column in the thrice tenth kingdom. But against all their evil plans, the hunter catches the beast, with the help of his wife.
The king is enraged with the steward, who again goes to the same stranger.  This time, the steward tells the king to send the hunter to ""go I know not whither and bring back I know not what.""  The wife conjures spirits and all the beasts and birds to see if they know how to ""go I know not whither and bring back I know not what.""  Then she goes out to sea and summons all the fish. But none of them can help her, so she gives him a ball, which if rolled before him would lead him where he needs to go, and a handkerchief, with directions to wipe his face with it whenever he washes.  He leaves.  The king sends a carriage for his ""wife"".  She turns back into a bird and leaves.
Her husband finally comes to the old witch Baba Yaga. She gives him food and lets him rest; then she brings him water to wash. He wipes his face not with their towel but his handkerchief.  She recognizes it as their sister's. She questions him, and he tells his story. The witch, who had never heard of something like that, knows an old frog who she thinks may know something. 
Baba Yaga gives him a jug to carry the frog, which can't walk fast enough.  He does so, and the frog directs him to a river, where it tells him to get on the frog, and it swells large enough to carry him across.  There, it directs him to listen to the old men who will arrive soon.  He does and hears them summon ""Shmat Razum"" to serve them.  Then the old men leave, and he hears Shmat Razum lament how they treated him.  The men ask Shmat Razum to serve the hunter instead, and Shmat Razum agrees.   
Shmat Razum carries him back. The hunter stops at a golden arbor, where he meets three merchants.  With Shmat Razum's directions, he exchanges his servant for three marvels, which could summon up a garden, a fleet of ships, and an army. But after a day, Shmat Razum returns to the hunter.  
In his own country, the hunter has Shmat Razum build a castle.  His wife returns to him there.  The former king of the country sees the castle and marches against the hunter. The new king, with the help of his wife, summons the fleet and the army. They defeat the other king and the hunter is chosen as the king in his place."

graciosa_and_percinet,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graciosa_and_Percinet,Graciosa and Percinet,"Graciosa and Percinet is a French literary fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy.  Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A king and queen had a beautiful daughter, Graciosa, and an ugly duchess hated her.  One day, the queen died.  The king grieved so much that his doctors ordered him to hunt.  Weary, he stopped at the duchess's castle and discovered how rich she was.  He agreed to marry her even though she demanded control of her stepdaughter.
The princess was reasoned into behaving well by her nurse.  A handsome young page, Percinet, appeared.  He was a rich young prince with a fairy gift, and he was in her service.  He gave her a horse to ride to greet the duchess.  It made the duchess's look ugly, and she demanded it, and that Percinet led it as he led it for Graciosa. Nevertheless, the horse ran away, and her disarray made her look even uglier. The duchess had Graciosa beaten with rods, except that the rods were turned into peacock feathers, and she suffered no harm.
The wedding went on, and the king arranged a tournament to flatter the queen.  The king's knights overthrew all the challengers, for all the ugliness of the queen, until a young challenger overthrew them and showed the portrait of the princess as the most beautiful woman in the world.  The queen had her abandoned in the woods.  Percinet rescued her, but she wished to return to her father, and when Percinet showed her how the queen had claimed her dead and buried a log of wood in her place, she insisted.  He told her that she would never see his castle again until she was buried.

The king was glad to see her, but when the queen returned and insisted, he seemed convinced that Graciosa was an imposter.  The queen imprisoned her, and with the aid of a wicked fairy, set her to disentangle a skein, on pain of her life.  Graciosa thought Percinet would not aid her, but finally in despair called on him, and he disentangled it.  The outraged queen set her to sort a room filled with feathers, and Percinet did that as well.  Then the queen set her to bring a box to her own castle, and forbade her to open it.  Curiosity got the better of her, and Graciosa freed a swarm of little men and women whom she could not get back in.  Percinet helped her.  The servants would not admit Graciosa, but gave her a letter telling they would not let her in.
The queen suggested that they lift a stone in the garden, which covered a well, on the grounds she had heard it covered a treasure.  When it was up, she pushed Graciosa in, and dropped the stone.  Percinet and his mother rescued her, and this time, Graciosa agreed to marry him."

Other tales of this type include Iron John and Georgic and Merlin.

","A king, Filippomaria, had an only son, Guerrino.  One day, while hunting, the king captured a wild man.  Imprisoning him, he gave the keys to the queen.  He set out hunting again, and Guerrino wanted to see the wild man.  The wild man stole an arrow he carried and promised to give it back if Guerrino freed him.  Guerrino did so and warned him to flee; the wild man told him that he would and left. (The wild man in fact had been a handsome youth who had despaired of the love of a lady and so took to the wild.)
The queen woke and questioned everyone.  Guerrino told her that no one would be punished but him, because he did it.  The queen took two faithful servants, gave them money, and sent Guerrino away.  The king returned and found the wild man gone.  The queen told that Guerrino had done it, and then that she had sent Guerrino away, which enraged him even more, that she should think he would hold his son in less regard than the wild man.  He searched for him but did not find him.
The servants agreed to kill Guerrino, but they could not agree on how to divide the loot; while they still had not settled, a fine young man greeted them and asked to come with him, and Guerrino agreed.  This was the same wild man; he had met a fairy suffering from a distemper, who had burst out laughing at the sight of him and so been cured.  She transformed him, endowed him magic powers, and gave him a magic horse.
They came to a town, Irlanda, ruled by King Zifroi with two beautiful daughters, Potentiana and Eleuteria.  Guerrino took lodgings.  The young man made to go on, but Guerrino persuaded him to stay.  At the time, the lands were attacked by a wild horse and a wild mare that ruined crops and killed beasts, men, and women.  The two servants told the king that Guerrino had boasted that he could kill these horses.  The king summoned him and promised to reward him if he did it; when Guerrino hesitated, he threatened to execute him if he did not.  The young man told him to get a blacksmith's services from the king, and then have the blacksmith make enormous horseshoes for the young man's horse.  Then he had Guerrino ride the horse until he met the horse, at which point he should dismount, free the horse, and climb a tree.  Guerrino did this, the horses fought, and the wild one was defeated.  The king was pleased, but the servants furious because of their failure.  They said that Guerrino had boasted likewise of the wild mare, and the king set him to defeat it as well; he did, as he had the horse.
The night after, he was woken by a noise and found a wasp in a honey pot, which he freed.
The king summoned him, said he had to reward him, and offered him one of his daughters, if Guerrino could tell beneath their veils which was Potentiana, who had golden hair, and which Eleuteria, who had silver hair.  If he guessed wrong, he would be executed.  Guerrino went back to his lodgings, where the young man told him that the wasp would fly three times around Potentiana, and she would drive it off three times, that night.  Then he should identify her.  Guerrino said he did not know how he could reward him for his favors.  The young man told him that he was the wild man, and so he was but returning what Guerrino had done for him, and his name was Rubinetto.
Guerrino went to the palace, where the princesses were entirely covered with white veils.  The king told him to make his choice, time was passing, but Guerrino insisted on the full-time.  The wasp buzzed about Potentiana, and she drove it off.  Guerrino said she was Potentiana, and they married.   Rubinetto married Eleuteria.  Guerrino's parents heard of him, and he returned to them with his wife and Rubinetto and his wife, where they lived in happiness."
gyeonmyo_jaengju,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonmyo_jaengju,Gyeonmyo jaengju,"Gyeonmyo jaengju is a Korean folktale that has been traditionally been cited as the reason why cats and dogs fail to get along with each other.  The story appears in numerous variations in several history folktale collections.
The story is about a precious marble gifted to a poor fisherman by a mythic carp.  After the marble is stolen, the fisherman's dog and cat, out of gratitude for their master, steal back the marble.  On their way home, the cat loses the marble and the two fight about it.  The cat ultimately retrieves the marble and returns it to the fisherman.","Once there was an old man who caught fish for a living. One day, the fisherman caught a large carp but let it go when he saw the carp shedding tears. When the fisherman went to the seashore the next day, a boy appeared, introduced himself as the son of the Dragon King of the Sea, and told the fisherman that he was the carp the fisherman had spared the day before. The boy went on to thank the old fisherman and invited him to the Dragon King’s palace. The fisherman was well received by the Dragon King and gifted with a precious marble that made him rich once he returned home. Hearing news of this, an old woman in the neighboring village stole the precious marble by secretly switching it with a different marble, which dragged the old fisherman back into poverty.
The cat and the dog living with the fisherman saw the burglary as an opportunity to express their gratitude to their master and set out for the old woman’s house in the neighboring village. The cat and the dog threatened the mouse living at the old woman’s house to find out where she hid the precious marble.
While making their way back home, the dog had to swim across a river while the cat sat on the dog’s back with the marble in its mouth. However, when the dog kept asking the cat whether it was safely holding on to the marble, the cat finally opened its mouth to answer and dropped the marble into the river. This caused the cat and the dog to fight, after which the dog left for home and the cat remained by the riverside to eat some fish. When the precious marble turned up inside the fish it was eating, the cat brought the marble back to its master. From then on, the fisherman gave preference to the cat and kept the dog outside the house, which is how the relationship between the cat and the dog turned from friend to foe."
habrmani,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habrmani_(Armenian_folk_tale),Habrmani,"Habrmani, Habermani or Habermany, the Serpent-Prince (Armenian: Հաբրմանի ""Hăbĕrmāni"") is an Armenian folktale about a serpent prince that marries a human maiden.

","In a third version collected by Leon Surmelian, Habermany, the Serpent-Prince, a poor man that sells bramble and bushes for a living finds three eggs in a nest. He takes them home and asks his wife to cook them. He eats two of them; the third hatches a snake that wishes to become their son. One day, the serpent son asks his father to go to the king's court and ask for the princess's hand in marriage. The king rebuffs his proposal and orders his execution twice for this affront. The snake son resurrects him on both occasions. On the third time, the king concedes to the poor man's proposal, but orders him to build an even bigger palace than the royal one; to deliver the king seven camel-loads of precious gems by a diminute man; to fashion a carpet from the royal palace and line it with trees thicker than four men; and to find a unique wedding dress for his daughter. The snake son advises his father to go to the snake hole he found him and to ask a ""young mistress"" that the ""young master"" wants something done.

The king at last marries his youngest daughter to the snake son. On the wedding night, after the celebrations, the snake son takes off the snakeskin; he reveals he is a king's son named Habermany, cursed to be a snake for 40 days. If his wife stays quiet about his secret, he may be able to overcome the curse and become disenchanted. The princess is endlessly mocked and belittled by her owns family, but takes it in stride for her husband's sake. When her father, the king, announces a grand feast with a follow up tournament, Habermany says he will take part in the competition under the guise of a mysterious rider, riding on a white horse, and his wife is not to tell anything. A second tournament is organized and Habermany enters it as a Red Rider and as a Black Rider. Fed up with all the incessant mocking, the princess reveals the riders are one and the same: her husband, Habermany. Just as he warned her, the prince and everything he owns vanishes into thin air.

The princess decides to go after him by wearing iron sandals and a steel cane. She reaches a castle of bricks, the Crystal Castle, the Copper Castle, the Iron Castle, the Steel Castle, the Silver Castle and finally the Gold Castle. She sees a maidservant fetching water in a jug and asks her if this is the correct destination. The maidservant tells her that her master Habermany is burning, and she is getting water to cool him off. The princess passes her off as a dervish, says she might have the right medicine to give him, and secretly drops her ring inside the jug. Habermany recognizes the ring. The owner of the Gold Castle, a witch, orders the maidservant to bring the dervish inside.

Once the witch sees her, she suspects she is Habermany's human wife. The witch orders the dervish-princess to go to her sister's house and fetch a rolling pin for her. Habermany advises her how to procceed: to drink from a filthy river and compliment, to pick up a thorn from a thick bush and compliment it, to give hay to a ram and sheeptail to the wolf, to close an open door and open a closed door, to not eat anything from the witch's house, to get the rolling pin and to run away as quick as she can. She follows his instructions to the letter; the witch's sister tries to command the ram, the wolf, the doors, the thorn bush and the river to stop her in her tracks, but the objects disobey her. Finally, Habermany and his wife escape with the help of the three horses, by throwing objects behind them to deter the pursuers (the witch and her daughter), and by transforming into other people. Their last transformation changes the red horse into a rosebush, the princess into a long stick and himself into a snake coiled around it. The witch notices it is them, but Habermany, as a snake, jumps onto her neck and bites her. Safe at last, they return to the princess's father's kingdom."

The tennin sees him taking it and demands its return—she cannot return to Heaven without it. The fisherman argues with her, and finally promises to return it, if she will show him her dance or part of it. She accepts his offer. The Chorus explains the dance as symbolic of the daily changes of the moon. The words about ""three, five, and fifteen"" refer to the number of nights in the moon's changes.

It is also known as Hansel and Grettel, or Little Step Brother and Little Step Sister.
Hansel and Gretel are a brother and sister abandoned in a forest, where they fall into the hands of a witch who lives in a house made of gingerbread, cake, and candy. The cannibalistic witch intends to fatten the children before eventually eating them, but Gretel outwits the witch and kills her. The two children then escape with their lives and return home with the witch's treasure.""Hansel and Gretel"" is a tale of Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 327A. It also includes an episode of type 1121 ('Burning the Witch in Her Own Oven'). The story is set in medieval Germany. The tale has been adapted to various media, most notably the opera Hänsel und Gretel (1893) by Engelbert Humperdinck.","Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's second wife tells the woodcutter to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves, so that she and her husband do not starve to death. The woodcutter opposes the plan, but his wife claims that maybe a stranger will take the children in and provide for them, which the woodcutter and she simply cannot do. With the scheme seemingly justified, the woodcutter reluctantly is forced to submit to it. They are unaware that in the children's bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them.
The next day, the family walk deep into the woods and Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then follow the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's rage. Once again, provisions become scarce and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the front door locked.

The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs for them to follow to return back home. However, after they are once again abandoned, they find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After days of wandering, they follow a beautiful white bird to a clearing in the woods, and discover a large cottage built of gingerbread, cookies, cakes, and candy, with window panes of clear sugar. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the rooftop of the house, when the door opens and a ""very old woman"" emerges and lures the children inside with the promise of soft beds and delicious food. They enter without realizing that their hostess is a bloodthirsty witch who built the gingerbread house to waylay children to cook and eat them.
The next morning, the witch locks Hansel in an iron cage in the garden and forces Gretel into becoming a slave. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but serves Gretel nothing but crab shells. The witch then tries to touch Hansel's finger to see how fat he has become, but Hansel cleverly offers a thin bone he found in the cage. As the witch's eyes are too weak to notice the deception, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, ""be he fat or lean"".
She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and asks her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what the witch means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves her into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, and leaves ""the ungodly witch to be burned in ashes"". Gretel frees Hansel from the cage and the pair discover a vase full of treasure, including precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife died from some unknown cause. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after."
how_geirald_the_coward_was_punished,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Geirald_the_Coward_was_Punished,How Geirald the Coward was Punished,"How Geirald the Coward was Punished is an Icelandic fairy tale collected in Neuislandische Volksmärchen. Andrew Lang included it in 1904's The Brown Fairy Book.

","A poor knight had many children. One day, the oldest, Rosald, made a friend named Geirald who persuaded him to come with him on travels; Geirald would pay for him, if he let the credit for any adventures they had fall to him. Rosald agreed. His mother warned him to always keep his promise to Geirald.
They heard that a band of twelve robbers were set to ambush them, and at Rosald's insistence, they climbed over them and rolled down rocks, carrying the robbers away. The captain got to them, and Rosald fought him and killed him, and took a ring from his hand. This made them famous.
They wanted to stay the winter in a kingdom, but the king would only permit it if they killed a giant. They went to its home, and when it roused in the morning, Rosald struck it to the ground with a blow, and cut off its head. He gave the head to Geirald, to present to the king.
A queen came to that country. She ruled her own country, but her subjects were dissatisfied with it:  they wanted her to marry. She was impressed by the tales and asked the king, her uncle, if the two heroes might fight in a tourney against one of her pages. He agreed. Geirald tried to refuse, and Rosald eventually fought wearing Geirald's clothing, as he had promised. Geirald asked for the hand of the queen in marriage as his reward. The queen thought he was not the man who had fought, and said he must fight against Rosald, as an additional test. Rosald feigned being defeated. Then the queen demanded that the two of them fight against two knights of hers. Geirald did not show up for that fight, and the queen declared she would marry Rosald. She told him that she had recognized the ring he wore during the fight (she being the page), and that Geirald had not worn it when he claimed her hand. Because he was faithful to his word to Geirald, she knew he would be a good king.
One day, many years later, a beggar came to their castle, and it was Geirald."

He recorded it from a quarryman in Knockderry, Roseneath, named Angus Campbell.Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book.

","A king and a queen had a son, Ian. When Ian was almost grown to a man, his mother died, and his father remarried.  One day Ian went hunting and shot at a blue falcon, knocking off a feather.  His stepmother cursed him until he found her the falcon.  He cursed her to stand with one foot on the great hall and the other on the castle, and always face the wind, until he returned, and left.

He met with Gille Mairtean the fox, who tells him that the blue falcon is kept by the Giant of the Five Heads, and the Five Necks, and the Five Humps, and to seek service there tending animals.  If he, above all, treats the birds kindly, the giant will let him care for the blue falcon, and then he can steal it, if he does not let any of its feathers touch anything in the house.  In time the giant trusted him, but the falcon started by the doorpost, and the feather touching the post made it scream and brought back the giant.  The giant tells him he may have the falcon if he brings him the White Sword of Light, owned by the Big Women of Dhiurradh.
Gille Mairtean turned himself into a boat and carried Ian to the island of Dhiurradh, and told him to seek service there, polishing gold and silver, which will let him, in time, steal the sword, but he must not let its sheath touch anything within the house.  This succeeded until the tip of the sheath touched the doorpost, and it shrieked.  The Big Women told him he may have the sword if he brings them the bay colt of the King of Erin.
Gille Mairtean turned himself into a boat, and carried Ian to the castle, where he served in the stable until he had a chance to steal the colt, which swished its tail against the door, and the king told him he must bring him the daughter of the king of the Franks.
Gille Mairtean turned himself into a boat and carried him to France.  The boat ran himself into the cleft of a rock, and sent Ian to say he had been shipwrecked.  The royal court came down to see the boat, and music came out of it.  The princess said she must see the harp that played such music, and Ian and Gille Mairtean carried her off.  She was angry, he explained why he needed to carry her off, and she said she would rather marry him.
They returned to the king, and Gille turned himself into a beautiful woman, and had Ian give him instead of the princess.  After Ian received the bay colt, Gille bit the king, knocking him unconscious, and escaped, and they returned to the Big Women.  Gille turned himself into a bay colt, and after Ian received the sword, threw it at all the Big Women, killing them.  They returned to the giant, and Gille turned himself into a sword and, once Ian had received the blue falcon, cut off the giant's heads.
Gille warned Ian how to carry what he had brought back to the castle, to prevent his stepmother turning him into a bundle of sticks.  He obeyed, and his stepmother was turned into a bundle of sticks herself.  So Ian burned her, married the princess, and lived ever afterwards in friendship with Gille Mairtean the fox."

It is classed as ATU type 513 A, or the ""Six Go through the Whole World"" type.The Grimms' main version is the one of many collected from storyteller Dorothea Viehmann, localized in Zwehren; a version close to it known in Paderborn is also discussed in their notes.""How Six Men got on in the World"" (Hunt, 1884), ""How Six Travelled through the World"" (Wehnert, 1853) are among other English-translated title given for this tale. A lesser known translation was given as Fritz and his Friends.","A soldier discharged from military duty receives only three coins for his service. He vows that the king will one day hand over all his treasures. While traveling, the soldier meets five others with extraordinary abilities, and recruits them to become his servants. They are: a strong man who pulled six trees from the ground with his bare hands, a keen-eyed hunter who was taking aim at a fly on a twig two miles away, a man whose breath could turn seven windmills, a fast runner who had to remove one leg to slow himself down, and a man who causes a terrible frost in the air unless he wears his hat crooked over one ear.

The soldier and his servants go to town where the king has organized a footrace with his daughter: the reward for victory was her hand in marriage, and punishment for defeat was death. The contestant and the princess must carry a pitcher (de: Krug) of the same kind, draw water from a certain well and return. The soldier is granted permission to have his servant substitute for him in the race, and the fast runner completely outdistances the daughter immediately. But after he fills his pitcher, he feels weary halfway on his return, and takes a nap using a horse's skull as pillow  This does not prevent him from oversleeping, and the daughter catches up with him and upsets his pitcher. The keen-eyed hunter witnesses this, and shoots the skull from under his head. The runner wakes, refills his pitcher and finishes the race well ahead of the princess.

The princess does not wish to marry a common ex-soldier, and the king decides not to honor the promise by plotting murder. He invites the six companions into an iron-floored room for a banquet, and orders a fire be stoked from underneath to roast them to death. But death is averted thanks to the ability of the frost-bringer, who straightens his hat.The king, baffled that the men survived, bribes the soldier into renouncing marriage to his daughter. The soldier asks for as much gold as his servant can carry, and the strong man carries all the king's wealth in a huge bag, and they leave. The king angrily sends soldiers on horseback after them, but the man with the powerful breath power blows all the soldiers away. One sergeant is spared alive and sent back to tell the king what happened. Upon hearing the events the monarch decides to leave the soldier and his servants alone to live rich and happy for the rest of their lives."

The fox brought the basket to the king, who was astounded that anyone had pears that time of year. The next day, it did the same, and asked for the princess's hand in marriage for his master, Count Piro, saying his master was so rich he would ask for no dowry.

The boy went to the castle and said very little, but the fox explained it was his great concerns that kept him quiet.
Then the fox took a third basket of pears and arranged for the wedding. Once they were married, the king and princess set out with the boy. The fox told a shepherd for an ogre that if he told the men that the sheep belonged to an ogre, the men would kill the sheep, and the ogre would kill him; he should say they belonged to Count Piro. It did the same with a pigherd and a horseherd. The king was impressed by the wealth.
At the ogre's castle, the fox told the ogre and ogress that the king had sent men to kill them, and it was best to hide in the oven until they passed. It trapped them in, and after the princess and her bridegroom were abed, the fox burned the ogre and ogress to death.
The beggar boy lived out his life in wealth and prosperity, and when the fox died, he held him a proper funeral."

It was collected and originally published in German as ""Der Teufel heirathet drei Schwestern"" by Widter and Wolf in 1866.It is classified as Aarne-Thompson tale type 311, ""The heroine rescues herself and her sisters"".Italo Calvino's retelling, entitled Silver Nose in his Italian Folktales (1956) is a composite, with its skeletal plot based on a Piedmont version featuring the devil-husband with a silver nose, fleshed out using variants from other localities.

","The following version was given by Widter and Wolf (Thomas Frederic Crane tr.):Once, the Devil decided to marry. He prepared a house, disguised himself as a fine gentleman, and came calling on a family to woo their three daughters. The oldest agreed to marry him.  When he took her home, he forbade her to look in a door, but as soon as he left, she did so, and hellfire in the door singed the little flower bouquet that she wore on her bosom. She could not hide what had happened, so the Devil said her curiosity would be satisfied, and threw her into hell. A few months later, he wooed the second daughter, but the same fate befell her as her sister.
Then he came to woo the youngest daughter, Margerita. She was a clever one, and suspected he had murdered her sisters, but the match was so good, it would have been a challenge to find one better. When administered the same test, she too was overcome by curiosity and opened the forbidden door, making the discovery that hell lay beyond it, that her sisters were there, and the man she wedded was the Devil. Margerita pulled out her two sisters and hid them away. By happenstance, she had placed her flower in water and it remained unscathed by fire, so her action went undetected. The Devil, reassured when he saw her flowers still fresh, came to love her unconditionally.
Hatching an escape plan, Margerita asked the Devil to carry each of three chests to her parents, making him promise never to put it down along the way. She said she will be watching. The Devil was tempted to unload the chest, but every time he was stopped by a voice that cried ""Don't put it down; I see you!"" although the shouting had really come from the first sister he was carrying inside the chest. It was a marvel to the Devil that his wife could see so far, and around corners even. The second sister was smuggled out in the same fashion on the back of the duped Devil. The third chest was for Margerita herself to be concealed inside. A dummy posing as her was affixed to the balcony (poggiolo) as if to keep watch, after which the maid helped load the chest upon the Devil's back. The Devil delivered the burden with even more exertion this time, thinking she was on the lookout from higher ground this time.
After returning, the Devil called out for Margerita, but his wife was nowhere to greet him. Spotting the figure on the balcony, he told her to come down, protesting of dog-like weariness (""stracco da can"") and wolf-like hunger (""una fame da lov""). Then he dashed up and struck her hard in the ear, only to discover it to be a dummy made of rags, with a fake head which was only a hatmaker's mold. Searching the house, he found her jewel box ransacked. He hurried off to his in-laws' house and there found his three wives alive and laughing scornfully at him, and the thought of three at once made him flee.
Since then, the Devil has lost the appetite to ever marry again."

Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. It is Aarne-Thompson type 328, the boy steals the giant's treasures.

","An older brother was jealous of his younger brother and one day tied him to a tree to be rid of him.  An old, humpbacked shepherd saw him and asked him why; the younger brother said it was to straighten out his back, and persuaded the shepherd to be tied there in his place.  Then he drove off the sheep.  He persuaded a horse boy and a driver of oxen to come with him.  He played many tricks and became famous.
The king captured him, said he had earned death, and promised to spare him if he brought him the dragon's flying horse.  He went and tried three times to steal the horse.  Each time it neighed, alerting the dragon, but the third time the dragon, annoyed at being awoken, beat the horse.  The fourth time, the horse did not neigh, the boy led him out, and once out, he mounted and rode off, taunting the dragon.
The king then demanded the dragon's bed coverings.  The boy went and tried to hook the blanket during the night, but the dragon said his wife was hogging them, and pulled them, pulling the boy down.  The dragon tied him and told his wife to cook him the next day while he went to church.  When he returned, they would eat him.  The dragoness untied him to cut his throat more easily, and the boy cut her throat and threw her into the oven.  He stole the bedcoverings and returned to the king.
The king then demanded the dragon itself.  The boy demanded two years to let his beard grow as a disguise, and the king agreed.  When the two years were up, the youth changed clothing with a beggar and found the dragon making a box, in order to trap him in it.  The youth said that the box was too small.  The dragon assured him that it was big enough even for himself and wriggled in to show him.  The youth clapped on the top and told him to see if the youth would be able to escape.  The dragon tried as hard as it could, and could not get out.
The youth brought him back to the king.  The king wanted to see the dragon.  He was careful enough to open a hole too small for the dragon to escape, but not enough to keep it from biting him and swallowing him whole.  The youth married the king's daughter and became king in his place."

When he was twelve, his father died.  When his eighteenth birthday grew near, the queen grieved over the thought of not seeing him for a year; she tried to put her son off, but when his consolations for her pretended causes did not work, she had to reveal the truth.  He assured her that he would return.
The queen gave him apples and told him that he needed a companion, but he should invite any prospect to eat with him, and then he should cut an apple into two unequal parts and reject anyone who did not take the smaller.  He met three young men, each of whom also claimed to be going on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James, but the first two wanted the larger part, and the prince feigned illness to be rid of them.  The third took the smaller, and they traveled together, having pledged that if one died, the other would bring his body.  It took them a year to reach the shrine.  At one point, they hired a house to rest before they continued.
The king saw them, thought them both handsome but the prince the handsomer, and resolved to marry his daughter to the prince.  He invited them both to dinner, and poisoned the friend, thinking that would keep the prince from travelling on.  Instead, the prince instantly resolved to go on.  The king offered his daughter, but the prince went on, and brought his friend's body with him.

iron_john,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_John,Iron John,"""Iron John"" (AKA ""Iron Hans"" or ""Der Eisenhans"") is a German fairy tale found in the collections of the Brothers Grimm, tale number 136, about a wild iron-skinned man and a prince. The original German title is Eisenhans, a compound of Eisen ""iron"" and Hans (like English John, a common short form of the personal name Johannes). It represents Aarne–Thompson type 502, ""The wild man as a helper"".Most people see the story as a parable about a boy maturing into adulthood.  The story also became the basis for the book Iron John: A Book About Men by Robert Bly which spawned the mythopoetic men's movement in the early 1990s after spending 62 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.","A king sends a huntsman into a forest nearby and the huntsman never returns. The King sends more men into the forest where they each meet with the same fate. The King sends all his remaining huntsmen out as a group, but again, none return. The king proclaims the woods as dangerous and off-limits to all.
Some years later, a wandering explorer accompanied by a dog hears of these dangerous woods and asks permission to hunt in the forest, claiming that he might be able to discover the fate of the other hunters. The man and his dog are allowed to enter. As they come to a lake in the middle of the forest, the dog is dragged under water by a giant arm. The hunter returns to the forest the next day with a group of men to empty the lake. They find a naked man with iron-like skin and long shaggy hair all over his body. They capture him and he is locked in a cage in the courtyard as a curiosity. The king declares that no one is allowed to set the wild man free or they will face the penalty of death.
Years later, the young prince is playing with a ball in the courtyard. He accidentally rolls it into the cage where the wild iron-skinned man picks it up and will only return it if he is set free. He states further that the only key to the cage is hidden beneath the queen's pillow.
Though the prince hesitates, he eventually builds up the courage to sneak into his mother's room and steal the key. He releases the wild iron-skinned man who reveals his name to be Iron John (or Iron Hans depending on the translation). The prince fears he will be killed for setting Iron John free, so Iron John agrees to take the prince with him into the forest.
Iron John is a powerful being and has many treasures that he guards. He sets the prince to watch over his well, but warns him not to let anything touch it or fall in because it will turn instantly to gold. The prince obeys at first, but begins to play in the well, eventually turning all his hair into gold. Disappointed in the boy's failure, Iron John sends him away to experience poverty and struggle. Iron John also tells the prince that if he ever needs anything, simply to call the name of Iron John three times.
The prince travels to a distant land and offers his services to its king. Since he is ashamed of his golden hair, he refuses to remove his cap before the king and is sent to assist the gardener.
When war comes to the kingdom, the prince sees his chance to make a name for himself. He calls upon Iron John who gives him a horse, armor, and a legion of iron warriors to fight alongside him. The prince successfully defends his new homeland, but returns all that he borrowed to Iron John before returning to his former position.
In celebration, the king announces a banquet and offers his daughter's hand in marriage to any one of the knights who can catch a golden apple that will be thrown into their midst. The king hopes that the mysterious knight who saved the kingdom will show himself for such a prize. Again the prince asks Iron John for help, and again Iron John disguises the prince as the mysterious knight. Though the prince catches the golden apple and escapes, and does so again on two more occasions, he is eventually found.
The prince is returned to his former station, marries the princess, and is happily reunited with his parents. Iron John too comes to the wedding. This time, he is seen without the shaggy hair or iron skin that made him frightening. Iron John reveals he was under enchantment until he found someone worthy and pure of heart to set him free."

Ruth Manning-Sanders included it in The Red King and the Witch: Gypsy Folk and Fairy Tales.

","Jack lived with his parents in the forest, never seeing anyone else.  He decided to leave one day, and his mother offered him a big cake with her curse or a little one with her blessing.  He took the big one.  He met his father on the way, and his father gave him a golden snuff-box, to open only when he was in danger of death.
He came to a house and asked for some food and a place to stay.  The servant told the master, who asked him what he could do; he said, anything, meaning any bit of work about the house, but the master demanded a great lake and a man-of-war on it, ready to fire a salute, or Jack would forfeit his life.  Jack opened the snuff-box, and three little red men hopped out.  He told them what was needed, and they told him to go to sleep.  In the morning, there was a lake and a man-of-war.
The master said that with two more tasks, he could marry his daughter.  He felled all the trees about, and built the master a castle with a regiment, and married the daughter.
One day, as they went on a hunt, a valet found the snuff-box and with it carried the castle and himself over the sea.  The master threatened to take Jack's wife from him, but agreed that Jack should have a year and a day to bring it back.  He set out and met the King of the Mice, who summoned all the mice in the world.  When none of them had seen it, he sent Jack on to the King of the Frogs, giving him a new horse.  A little mouse asked to come with him, Jack tried to refuse on the grounds of offending the king, but the mouse told him it would be better.  The King of the Frogs summoned all the frogs in the world.  When none of them had seen it, he sent Jack on to the King of the Birds.  A little frog asked to come with him, and again Jack was persuaded.  The King of the Birds summoned all the birds, and last of all, an eagle came, and told of the castle.  The eagle carried him to it, and the mouse stole the box back.  They quarreled as they went back, and the box fell into the sea, but the frog retrieved it.
When he returned to the King of the Birds, he had the little men retrieve the castle.  The men waited until everyone there but a cook and a maid had left for a dance; then they asked them whether they would rather go or stay, and when they said go, told them to run into the castle.  Then Jack had them carry it to the King of the Frogs, and then next day to the King of the Mice, where he left it and rode home on his horse.  There, he had the little men bring him the castle, and his wife showed him his new son."
jack_and_his_comrades,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_his_Comrades,Jack and His Comrades,"Jack and his Comrades is a short Irish fairy tale describing the title character's story of success with the help of his animal helpers, collected by folklorist Patrick Kennedy from a resident of County Wexford, Ireland, and published in Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (1866). It was later reprinted, revised but only slightly, by Joseph Jacobs in his Celtic fairy tale compilation.In the Aarne-Thompson categorisation system, this can be classed as ""folktale type 130"", i.e.  ""outcast animals find a new home"".Kennedy collected the tale from a man named Garrett (Gerald) Forrestal, residing in the former barony of Bantry, in Wexford.

","Jack tells his mother he will seek his fortune.  His mother offers him half a hen and half a cake with her blessing, or the whole of both without; he asks for the halves and is given the whole of both, with her blessing.  On his way, he meets a donkey (Neddy) in a bog and helps it out.  A dog (Coley) runs up to him for protection, with a pot tied to its tail and a crowd hunting it; the donkey bellows and scares them off and Jack unties the pot.  He shares his meal with the dog, while the donkey eats thistles; a half-starved cat (Tom) comes by, and Jack gives it a bone with meat.  In the evening, they rescue a cockerel from a fox. (The cockerel is referred to as Irish: Cuileach Dhubh or ""Black Cock"").
They go to sleep in the woods.  The cockerel crows, claiming to see dawn, and Jack realises that it's a candle in a house.  They spy a look inside, and discover it to be a robbers' den.  With the donkey placing its fore-hoofs on the window-sill, the animals stack one on top of another and make noise, then, at Jack's deceptive call to raise the pistols and fire, the beasts smash all the window panes, frightening the robbers into bolting the house and riding far out into the woods.  Jack and the animals enter the house, enjoy a meal, and go to sleep.  After a while, the captain of the robbers sorely misses the loot he left behind. So he sneaks back inside the house in the dark, only to receive scratches from the cat, a bite from the dog, pecking from the cockerel, and finally a great kick from the donkey at the stable outside. The captain (who could see nothing in the dark) weaves a fancifully horrid account of what happened, adding that not all the plaster (a healing salve or potion, often applied thickly) in Enniscorthy would heal the cuts and wounds he received, and the other robbers lose all craving of trying to retrieve their loot.
Jack and comrades resolve next day to return the stolen gold to its owner, and journey to the manor of the Lord of Dunlavin. Jack is halted at the door by the crooked porter. Jack and the rest know from the thieves' conversation the night before that this porter was in league with the thieves, and complicit in the crime. The cockerel makes a sarcastic remark, plainly accusing the porter of giving the thieves free passage through the door to his master's house, and the porter's face turns completely crimson.  The interchange is witnessed by the Lord of Dunlavin, who, addressing the porter by name (Barney), prods him to answer the charge, and the porter replies ""sure I didn't open the door to the six robbers,"" thus betraying his own familiarity with the perpetrators.
Jack announces that, no matter, he has arrived with the stolen gold and silver, and requested a supper and lodging after a long ride from Athsalach ('muddy ford'). The grateful lord declares he would provide them comfort for the rest of their days, appointing Jack as his steward, brought his mother to live near the castle, and eventually married his lordship's daughter."

","A fat woman had an ugly beast older daughter, Marbo, and a beautiful younger daughter, Kallo.  People admired Kallo and pitied Marbo; Marbo resented it and made Kallo do all the work.  One day, the mother asked for one of them to go to the mill to grind flour; Marbo insisted on sending Kallo.  Kallo got there, many people were grinding, and her grain was poured in just before the miller went to bed; she had to wait.  At midnight, goblins came out and threatened to eat her.  Kallo said they could not eat her in her old dress; she needed a new dress.  When they stole a fine dress for her, she said she needed other things, a coat, an umbrella, a comb, face powder, and anything she could think of.  Then dawn came, and the goblins had to leave.  The miller ground her grain, and Kallo went back with what the goblins had given her and the flour.
Marbo envied her and wasted the flour.  On New Year's Day, more was needed, and Marbo went for it.  When the goblins came, they scratched her face, and she screamed for help; the miller saved her, but she gained nothing.  Kallo used the goblins' face powder on her and healed her face."
kate_crackernuts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Crackernuts,Kate Crackernuts,"""Kate Crackernuts"" (or ""Katie Crackernuts"") is a Scottish fairy tale collected by Andrew Lang in the Orkney Islands and published  in Longman's Magazine in 1889. Joseph Jacobs edited and republished the tale in his English Fairy Tales (1890). The tale is about a princess who rescues her beautiful sister from an evil enchantment and a prince from a wasting sickness caused by dancing nightly with the fairies. The tale has been adapted to a children's novel and a stage play.

","A king had a daughter named Anne, and his queen had a daughter named Kate, who was less beautiful. (Jacobs' notes reveal that in the original story both girls were called Kate and that he had changed one's name to Anne.)  The queen was jealous of Anne, but Kate loved her. The queen consulted with a henwife to ruin Anne's beauty, and after three tries, they enchanted Anne's head into a sheep's head.  Kate wrapped Anne's head in a cloth, and they went out to seek their fortunes.
They found a castle of a king who had two sons, one of whom was sickening. Whoever watched him at night mysteriously vanished, so the king offered silver to anyone who would watch him. Kate asked for shelter for herself and her ""sick"" sister, and offered to watch him. At midnight, the sick prince rose and rode off. Kate sneaked onto his horse and collected nuts as they rode through the woods. A green hill where the fairies were dancing opened to receive the prince, and Kate rode in with him unnoticed. The prince danced with the fairies until the morning before rushing back.
Kate offered to watch the prince a second night for gold. The second night passed as the first but Kate found a fairy baby in the hill. It played with a wand, and she heard fairies say that three strokes of the wand would cure Anne. So she rolled nuts to distract the baby and got the wand, then cured her sister.
The third night, Kate said she would stay only if she could marry the prince, and that night, the baby played with a bird, three bites of which would cure the sick prince. She distracted the baby with the nuts again to get it. As soon as they returned to the castle, she cooked it, and the prince was cured by eating it. Meanwhile, his brother had seen Anne and fell in love with her, so they all married — the sick brother to the well sister, and the well brother to the sick sister."
kathasaritsagara,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathasaritsagara,Kathasaritsagara,"The Kathāsaritsāgara (""Ocean of the Streams of Stories"") (Devanagari: कथासरित्सागर) is a famous 11th-century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold in Sanskrit by the Shaivite Somadeva.
Kathāsaritsāgara contains multiple layers of story within a story and is said to have been adopted from Guṇāḍhya's Bṛhatkathā (""the Great Narrative""), which was written in a poorly-understood language known as Paiśāchī. The Bṛhatkathā is no longer extant but several later adaptations still exist — the Kathāsaritsāgara, Bṛhatkathamanjari and Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha. However, none of these recensions necessarily derives directly from Gunadhya, and each may have intermediate versions. Scholars compare Guṇāḍhya with Vyasa and Valmiki even though he did not write the now long-lost Bṛhatkathā in Sanskrit. Presently available are its two Sanskrit recensions, the Bṛhatkathamanjari by Kṣemendra and the Kathāsaritsāgara by Somadeva.","The Kathāsaritsāgara is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are Udayana, king of Kosambi, and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the Vidyadharas, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections."

Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.It is Aarne–Thompson type 510A, the persecuted heroine.  Others of this type include ""Cinderella"", ""The Sharp Grey Sheep"", ""The Golden Slipper"", ""The Story of Tam and Cam"", ""Rushen Coatie"", ""The Wonderful Birch"", and ""Fair, Brown and Trembling"".

","A king, who had a daughter, married a widowed queen, who also had a daughter. Unfortunately, the king had to go to war and the stepmother maltreated and starved her stepdaughter. A dun bull helped the child, telling her that she would find a cloth in his left ear. When she pulled out the cloth and spread it out, she magically had all the food she needed. When the queen discovered this and, when the king returned, she feigned sickness and then bribed a doctor to say that she needed the flesh of the dun bull to be well again.
Fearful for the bull's life, the princess told him of her stepmother's plan. The bull decided that they must flee together. They passed through a forest made of copper trees and although the bull told her not to break off any branches, she broke off a leaf. Seeing this, the bull told the princess to keep the leaf safe and not lose it under any circumstances.
The bull and the princess came upon a troll that roared that they were touching his wood, and started a fight with the bull. The bull won, though he was gravely injured, and the princess had to cure him with a horn of ointment that the troll carried on his person.
The same thing happened in a silver wood and a golden one, and soon the princess had a silver leaf and a golden apple, along with the copper leaf.
The princess and the bull continued to travel until they came upon a castle. The bull gave her a wooden cloak and told her to ask for work at the castle as ""Katie Woodencloak"". However, she must first cut off the bull's head, flay him, and put the hide away in a rock, along with the leaves and apple. Should she need anything, the bull told the princess to knock on the stone.  Though at first the princess refused to kill the bull, she was eventually persuaded.
The princess went to castle and got work in the scullery. One day, she was told to carry water to the prince for bathing. The prince, not wanting to use water from such a filthy creature, threw it on her. Later, the princess went to the rock and asked to be magnificently dressed in copper. She went to a church, where the prince fell in love with her at once. She told him she came from Bath and used a charm to keep him from following her, but he had caught one of her gloves.
A second time, she brought him a towel, to the same treatment, and went to church dressed in silver. She told the prince she came from Towelland, and she dropped her riding whip.
The third time, she brought him a comb, to the same treatment, and went to church dressed in gold.  She told the prince she came from Combland, and he got her golden shoe.
Wanting to find the woman, the king had all women in the kingdom try on the shoe, and it fit Katie's stepsister. A bird warned the prince that the stepsister had cut her foot to fit in the shoe, and sang that it was Katie Woodencloak's shoe.
Having disposed of the false bride, the prince asked after Katie Woodencloak.  Though he was warned off, he insisted, so they married and lived happily ever after."
khastakhumar_and_bibinagar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khastakhumar_and_Bibinagar,Khastakhumar and Bibinagar,"Khastakhumār and Bībīnagār or Xasteh Xomār is an Afghan folktale. Both refer to a marriage between a human woman and an enchanted prince in snake form, and follow the internationally known narrative structure of ""The Search for the Lost Husband"".

","a poor, old thorn-gatherer, while in the fields, lifts a stone and finds a hidden cache of flour. Thinking it is a divine blessing, he takes some and brings it home. When he returns, he sees a snake on top of the trapdoor, who explains it is the owner of the flour and demands one of the man's daughters in return. He tells the situation to his three daughters, but only the youngest accepts to be delivered to the snake.

She sits on a camel to be taken to her snake husband. A handsome man greets her and takes her to an underground palace. He explains that he wears a snake skin, but is otherwise human.[a] He gives her free rein on all his properties.

Some time later, her sisters want to visit her, and her elder gets curious about the snake skin. She prompts the youngest to ask her husband about it later that night. She does and is repproached by her husband, warning her that if the skin is burnt, it may lead to disgrace for both of them. He says her question is foolish, but answers that it can be burnt with onion and garlic skins.

The girl naïvely tells her sisters about it the next time they visit. Her sisters heat up the oven and throw the snakeskin inside, just as Xasteh Xomar appears to try to stop them. As the skin burns, the grand palace and everything within it vanish, leaving only the girls, and a betrayed Xasteh Xomar. He tells his wife that, if she ever wants to see him again, she must head westwards, wearing seven pairs of iron shoes and seven iron canes, but warns her that his own family is entirely made of divs that may devour her.

Later, the girl goes after him with the needed garments. She passes by a herd of camels, a herd of cows, a herd of sheep and a herd of goats - all the brideprice of Bibi Negar. She finally stops by her husband's place. While she rests, she sees a servant girl come out of the building to fetch some water. She begs the girl to drink some, but the servant refuses and tells her the water is for her master. The girl curses the water to become blood, then pus, and by the third time the servant goes to the fountain, she finally gives the girl a drink of water. She discreetly lets her ring inside the jug. When the servant takes the jug to Xasteh Xomar, he recognizes the ring and brings the girl home.

Xasteh Xomar is happy to see his human wife, but reminds her of the warning about his family. So he turns her into a needle to hide her presence from the divs. However, his div mother notices the human smell on him and wants her son to reveal the human he is hiding. Xasteh Xomar makes her promise not to harm his human wife (who he passes off as a servant). The div mother still forces her to do chores for them: to sweep the floor and sprinkle water over it; to take a black mat and wash it white, and to wash it back to black. Xasteh Xomār invokes magic help in the name of prophet Solomon and helps his wife in her tasks.

Thirdly, the div mother sends the girl to go to her sister's house and bring a comb, a mirror and scissors. Xasteh Xomar advises her to compliment everything on its way, no matter if ugly or repulsive; to give the correct food for the dog and the camel; to get the objects and run away as fast as she can. She does as instructed and returns to the div mother's house with the requested items.

Finally, the div mother prepares the wedding of Xasteh Xomar with his cousin, Bibi Negar.[b] His div mother wraps cotton around the human girl's fingers, butters them with ghee, lights the improvised candles and forces her to illuminate the wedding procession. Xasteh Xomar's human wife cries out that her fingers are burning, but Xasteh Xomar himself is also suffering with his mother's ploy. When the ceremony ends, Xasteh Xomar insists that the servant girl sleeps by the door, in case he and his new wife need something.

That night, Xasteh Xomar heats up a cauldron of cooking fat, takes his new wife and dumps her inside the cooking pot. He at last awakens his human wife, takes some objects from the house and both escape.

The next morning, his div family notices that he has not awakened yet, nor has his bride. They notice that the bride Bibi Negar has been cooked like a meal, and decide to go after the runaway couple. His aunt and mother follow them in a cloud of smoke. Xasteh Xomar notices their approach and throws objects to deter them, invoking the name of prophet Solomon to work the magic. The last object creates a lake. Xasteh Xomar deceives his family by saying that he crossed the lake by carrying a mountain on each shoulder and a millstone around their neck. His relatives repeat the action and sink to the bottom of the lake, never to return.

Xasteh Xomar and his human wife return to their palace."

Louis Léger remarked that its source (Bajarz polski) was ""one of the most important collections of Polish literature"".

","A king and a queen had no children.  One day, the king was travelling (hunting to forget his childlessness in the Polish, inspecting his country in the Russian), and grew thirsty.  He found a spring with a cup floating in it.  Trying to grab the cup did not succeed; it always evaded his hands.  When he dropped to drink directly, a creature in the well (the King Kostiei in Polish), grabbed his beard and would not free him until he promised to give it something:  in Polish, the most precious thing in his palace, which was not there when he left it; in the Russian, something he knew nothing about, and which he would find on his return home.
He promised.  On his return, he found his wife had a son.  He told no one of the exchange, but when the prince was grown, an old man appeared to him in the woods and told him to tell his father to make good on his bargain.  When he told the king, the king told him the truth.  The prince set out to pay it.
He came to a lake where thirty ducks (Russian) or twelve geese (Polish) were swimming, and where there were clothes on the shore.  He took one.  The birds came ashore, changed into women, and dressed themselves, except the one whose dress he had.  That one, as a bird, looked about, and begged the prince to give her back her clothing.  He did so.  She was grateful, told him that she was the youngest daughter of the man he had been promised to, and promised to aid him.  She told him that when he reached her father, he was to approach him on his knees, without any fear.
He obeyed her, although her father gave fearful yells.  When he had nearly reached him, her father laughed and said it was well that he had not been frightened.  In the morning, he ordered the prince to build him a marble palace in a day.  He went to his room, the daughter came to him as a bee, and promised to do it for him, and the next day, the palace was built.  The next day, he demanded that the prince pick out his youngest daughter from her sisters.  She told him she would be the one with the ladybug on her eyelid (Polish) or fly on her cheek (Russian), and he was able to find her.  The third day, he told the prince to make him a pair of boots.  The prince was no shoemaker, and the youngest daughter told him that they must flee.  She spat on the ground (Polish) or breathed on the window and made frost (Russian), and they fled.  When the servants came for the prince, the spit or frost answered for them. Finally, he ordered the door broken, which revealed their flight.
The servants chased them.  The maiden turned herself into a river, the prince into the bridge, and put three roads into the forest over the bridge.  The servants, not knowing which way to go, turned back.  Her father told them that they had been the bridge and river.  When the servants returned, the maiden turned herself and the prince into a dense forest, with many paths, and the servants became lost and could not find them.  When they returned, her father decided to chase them himself.  The maiden said that he could go no further than the first church.  She demanded his cross.  With it, she made herself a church and the prince a priest.  Her father demanded if the priest had seen them, and he said that they had passed and had sent their greetings.  Her father had to turn back.

","A beautiful, but spoiled and shallow princess rudely criticizes all her suitors because she is too proud. She is impressed with the last one, but her pride will not let her accept him. He is a young king with such a thick pointed beard, that to her it looks like a thrush's beak, so she cruelly dubs him King Thrushbeard. He leaves in anger. Her father, exasperated and angry at how she scorned them all, vows that the first man who comes to the palace the next day, whether he be a noble or a peasant, will become her husband. Meanwhile, an unknown stranger overhears the conversation.
When a young minstrel with a clean shaven face appears in the palace the next day, the king offers his daughter's hand in marriage. He disapproves of marrying her immediately as she does not look strong nor does she appear to be capable of any practical work. However, he notes the poor cannot be choosy and agrees to marry her. She opposes vehemently because he is a commoner, but the king has given his word. She marries him and he takes her away from the palace to his home.

As they travel to the minstrel's home, they pass by the fine lands and properties that belong to King Thrushbeard, and the princess begins to regret scorning him. They arrive at his home, a house fit only for swine. He treats her as though she was a commoner and she is upset now that she must work for a living. He has her doing practical chores such as cleaning the house, weaving baskets, and spinning cotton, at which she is completely inept. She is then sent to sell pottery in the marketplace and all seems to go well, until a drunken soldier on a horse passes by and smashes every single pot to pieces. Thoroughly annoyed at her constant failures, the minstrel tells her the only job left for her is to work as a servant at the nearby castle of a young king: King Thrushbeard.
The princess is initially ashamed that she must work in the palace of a suitor she so harshly scorned and deeply regrets doing so, but puts her pride aside when she realizes that her husband is depending on her to help out with the household. Eventually, she swallows the last of her pride and becomes so compassionate that she throws scraps of food to the mice who live in their home because she realizes they are hungry too.
Just as her life is going smoothly, the princess discovers one day that King Thrushbeard is getting married. She is forced into the great hall by him for a dance. It causes her pockets containing scraps of food to burst open, which spill all over the floor and everybody laughs. She is so embarrassed that she flees the hall crying.
However, much to the princess' surprise, someone follows and catches up with her. Dressed in finery is the minstrel, who smiles and asks why she is crying on her wedding day. She is shocked to discover he is really King Thrushbeard. He fell in love with her despite her scorn and secretly married her through her father's vow. Her ordeals (including his disguise as a drunken soldier) were meant to cure her of her proud, spoiled ways and punishment for her cruelty towards him. She is ashamed of herself and thanks him for teaching her to be compassionate to others, telling him that she is not worthy to be his wife. But he forgives her as he has seen that her experiences have changed her. They marry with her father at the wedding. She asks before the whole court that he grow his beard back. He, from then on, is known by no other name but King Thrushbeard and they all live happily ever after."

kobutori_jiisan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobutori_Jiisan,Kobutori Jiisan,"""Kobutori Jiisan"" (こぶとりじいさん, Kobutori jīsan) translated directly as ""Lump-Taken Old Man"" is a Japanese Folktale about an old man who had his lump (or parotid gland tumor) taken or removed by demons after joining a party of demons (oni) celebrating and dancing in the night.
The tale is a rendition of a tale about a woodcutter (firewood-gatherer) from the early 13th-century anthology Uji Shūi Monogatari.

","There was an old man with a lump on the right side of his face. (The lump was caused by a parotid gland tumor 耳下腺腫瘍 aka salivary gland tumor.) Ozaki's translation describes the lump to be ""like a tennis-ball"", while the Spanish translation makes the lump to be the size of a peach (Spanish: melocotón).One day he went into the mountain to cut wood, and was caught in the rain. He took refuge in the hollow of a tree. He was soon to witness a gathering of strange beings nearby, some one-eyed and some mouth-less. They were the oni (demons or ogres; ""devils"" being the Christendom equivalent).The oni created a great bonfire as bright as day. They began to drink sake, sing, and dance. The old man overcame his fears and was lured to join the dance. The greatly entertained oni wanted him to return the next day (or ""always"") for an encore. To ensure the old man's return, the oni wanted keep custody of some valuable possession, and of all things, decided the old man's lump should be taken as pledge. They then proceed to remove the unwanted tumor. The old man was elated to find the lump gone, with not a remnant of it remaining, and no soreness in the cheek where it was removed.There lived next door an old man who had a big lump on his left cheek. When he heard his neighbor's story about losing the lump, he wanted to emulate, and therefore asked to take the place of performing in front of the oni, and the neighbor yielded him the opportunity. The left-lump old man went to the same tree hollow, and when the oni assembled, the chief demon was particularly eagerly awaiting. Unfortunately, the left-lump old man did not have the same level of skill in the art of dancing, and was a disappointment to the demons, who bid him to take home another lump and leave. And the demons slapped on (or threw) the piece of flesh which stuck clean to the side of his face, and this old man returned home chagrined, now with two lumps on his face."

Prince Beuteusell meets a peasant maiden named Joana and asks her father's approval for their marriage. Her father boasts that Joana is even wiser than the queen Fairy Morgana, and a maidservant overhears it. She tells the queen of the boast and she summons father and daughter to her court.

Wratislaw in his Sixty Folk-Tales from Exclusively Slavonic Sources, number 40. Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book. Parker Fillmore included the tale as The Little Lame Fox in his book Jugoslav Fairy Tales.

","A man once always had one eye weeping and the other smiling.  He had three sons, of whom the youngest was rather foolish.  One day, out of curiosity, the sons each asked why one eye was weeping and the other smiling.  The father went into a rage, which frightened off the older two but not the youngest.  So the father told the youngest that his right eye smiled because he was glad to have a son like him, but his left eye wept because he once had a marvelous vine in his garden, and it had been stolen.
All three sons set out to find it, but the youngest parted with his older brothers at a crossroads.  A lame fox came up to the older brothers to beg bread, and they drove it off with sticks; it went to the younger, and he fed it.  It told him how to find the vine, and to dig it up with a wooden shovel rather than an iron one.  He thought the wooden shovel would not be strong enough, but the noise the iron shovel made woke the guards.
His captors told him he could have the vine if he brought them a golden apple. He went back to meet the fox, who told him where it was, and to use the wooden rather than the golden pole to get it, but he used the golden pole, which woke the guards. They told him he had to bring them a horse that could circle the world in a day. The fox told him where to find it, and to use the hempen halter rather than the golden one. He failed again, and his new captor told him he could be free if he brought him a golden maiden who never saw the sun or moon. He persuaded the man to lend him to the horse to help find her.
The fox led him to a cave where he found such a maiden. He brought her out and to his horse. The fox said it was a pity he had to exchange her, and turned himself into a replica of her. The youngest son got back his father's vine and married the real golden maiden as well."

One day, he met a bourgeois on a horse, who hired him on the promise of little work and feeding him; Johnny did not realize that he was the Devil.  At his home, the Devil showed him a horse (actually a prince he had transformed to that shape) and told him to beat it every morning.  Johnny did, but not hard, for fear of tiring himself.  After a few days, the horse warned him that he worked for the Devil, told him to take ten sacks of the Devil's gold, and had him ride off on it.  They rode through an ocean, where waters opened for them.  The Devil chased them, but every time he came close, the horse had Johnny drop a sack, so the Devil stopped to pick the money up.  When the tenth sack was dropped, they escaped the other side, and the waters closed on the Devil and drowned him.
Soon they reached the king's castle, where the king thought his son had been lost hunting.  The horse told Johnny to work as a gardener; they would set him to tend strawberries, and he should cut them at the root and lie down beside them.  He did that, and fell asleep.

It was published in 1826 in a collection of fairy tales and tells the story of an outsider called Little Muck.

","As a child, Muley knew a little person called Little Muck, who also lived in his home town Nicea in Turkey. Little Muck lived alone in a house, which he rarely left. Due to his misshapen figure and his unsuitable clothing Muley and his friends always made fun of him. One day, they were extremely mean to him. Thereupon Muley’s father gave him 50 blows with a pipe stem. After the first 25 blows he told him the following story:
Muck’s father Mukrah was a well-respected, but poor man, who lived as lonely as his son. He was ashamed of Muck’s misshapen figure and therefore he did not allow him any kind of education. When Mukrah died, his relatives inherited everything, as he owed them a lot of money. Muck only got a suit with wide trousers, a wide belt, a coat, a turban and a knife.
His father was tall and thus Little Muck cut off the legs and sleeves of the wide trousers without changing the width. Afterwards he left his home town to seek his fortune. Shortly afterwards Muck found an accommodation and a new job in another town: he had to take care of the cats and dogs of a mysterious woman called Miss Ahavzi.
One day Muck entered a forbidden room in Miss Ahavzi's house and accidentally destroyed an expensive bowl. He took two items of this room and decided to flee, as he did not get his wages and was often punished for no reason. These two items had, as it turned out, magical powers: With the pair of slippers, he could not only walk faster than any other person, but also fly to any place he wanted. And the walking stick showed him buried treasures.
The king was impressed by Muck's magic slippers, and thus offered him a position as a courier, which made the other servants jealous of him. With the help of his magic walking stick, Muck discovered a forgotten treasure in the palace garden one day. As he wanted to make new friends, he distributed all the gold he had found to other people. However, he was charged with theft and sent to prison.
At that time the official punishment for stealing royal property was death. However, Little Muck could save his life by telling the king more about the magic power of the slippers and the walking stick. Thereupon the king tried on the slippers, but as Muck did not show the king how to stop the slippers, the latter ran and ran until he passed out. He was very angry, confiscated the magic items and chased Muck away. After an eight-hour march, Little Muck finally reached the border of a small country.
By chance, he discovered two fig trees in a forest.  With the help of the figs he could retaliate: the first variety of figs caused the growth of huge donkey ears and a long nose; by eating the second variety of figs, it went back to normal. Dressed up as a salesman Little Muck smuggled the first variety of figs on the king's table. Shortly afterwards he dressed up as a scholar and offered the king the second variety of figs as a remedy for his and his royal court’s deformities.
After proving the effectiveness of his cure, the King led Muck into the treasury, where he should choose a reward. He immediately snatched his magic items and revealed his identity. With the help of his magic slippers Little Muck flew back home and left the disloyal king with his deformed face behind. Since then, he lived in his home town in great prosperity, but lonely as he despised other people.
""Muck became wise through experience and therefore he deserves admiration instead of mockery"", Muley's father ended his narrative and spared his son the remaining half of the blows. Muley told Muck's story to his friends, who were very impressed by the story of Muck's life. From this day forth they honored Muck and bowed before him whenever they saw him."

There he finds windows showing beautiful women, and a curtain over one window. He pulls away the curtain and falls in love with the woman he sees there. He tells his father, who tells him he should have left that window curtained, because the woman is the prisoner of an evil sorcerer, in an iron castle, but the prince has given his word and must try to rescue her.
On the way, he meets a man who wants to be taken into his service; his name is Long, and he can extend himself, and shows it by taking down a nest from a tall tree. The prince lets him come along. He also meets Broad, who can make himself grow until he is as large as a mountain, and Sharpsight, who keeps his eyes bandaged because he can see through the bandage, and without it his gaze would set things afire, or break them into pieces. The prince takes them into his service as well.
They reach the iron castle, and as soon as they are inside, the gates close. They find many men, turned to stone, and food laid out. As nobody is there, they eat the food.  The sorcerer appears with the woman and tells them they can have the princess if they could keep her from escaping for three nights. The prince tries to talk to her, but she does not answer. As the trio falls asleep, she vanishes, but Sharpsight spots her; she has turned into an acorn on an oak tree. Long brings her back. The wizard is furious. The next day, she becomes a precious stone on a mountain, but again Sharpsight sees her, and Long brings her back. The wizard is furious again. The third night, she becomes a golden ring on a shell in the sea. Long brings Broad with him, and Broad, making himself broad, drinks up the sea, while Long gets the ring. On the way back, however, he cannot carry Broad, but drops him. All the water comes out, and Broad barely manages to avoid drowning, but they eventually make it back.
The sorcerer turns into a crow, and all the people turned to stone comes back to life. The prince takes the woman home and marries her. Long, Broad, and Sharpsight leave his service and goes on to seek their fortune."

","Once, there was a young man who, even from childhood, had never grown any hair. One day, he saw the Sultan's daughter and became determined to marry her.
He first sent his mother to tell the Sultan that her son wanted to marry his daughter. The Sultan was intrigued by the request, and told the woman to send her son. However, by the time the son arrived, the Sultan's interest had waned, and he only wanted to be rid of the boy. So he told the boy that he must first gather all the birds of the world and bring them to the Sultan's garden, which had no birds.
After wandering for a time, the boy met a dervish, and asked his help. The dervish told him to go to a huge cypress tree down the road, and hide in its shadow until he heard a huge rush of wings. This would be all the birds in the world coming for a rest. He was to wait until they were sitting, then say the word ""madschun"", which would cause them to freeze and become motionless. He could then gather the birds and take them to the palace. And that is what the boy did.
The sultan was a little dismayed. He told the boy that he could marry the princess - after he grew a full head of hair.
Upset, the boy went home and brooded until he heard that the princess was to marry the son of the wazir. At this, he sneaked into the palace, found where the princess, the wazir's son, and some others were waiting, and said ""Madschun"". This froze all of them to the spot.

One such oral variant is The Thief and His Master.

","In Sicily, in the town of Messina, Maestro Lattantio had learned to be both a magician and a tailor.  He took an apprentice, Dionigi, to teach to be a tailor, but Dionigi spied on him and  lost all interest in being a tailor because of his desire to learn magic.  Lattantio sent him away, but his father sent him back, where Lattantio often punished him for his laziness, but Dionigi bore it because he could watch Lattantio secretly and learn his magic.  One day, his father found him doing housework rather than learning to be a tailor, and brought him home, grieved that after his money was spent, his son had not learned a trade.  
Dionigi turned himself into a horse, and had his father display him for sale.  Lattantio saw it and realized that it was Dionigi.  He changed himself into a merchant and bought the horse.  The father would not sell the bridle, but Lattantio increased his price until the father agreed.  Lattantio then took the horse home and mistreated it.  His two daughters pitied the horse and were kind to it.  One day, they took it down to the stream to drink, where it dashed into the water and became a little fish.  Lattantio, finding the horse gone, got his daughters to tell him what had happened, and turned himself into a tunny to chase Dionigi.  Dionigi swam near the shore, and jumped into a basket carried by a handmaiden of the king's daughter, turning himself into a ruby ring. Violante, the king's daughter, found the ring and put it on.  At night, when she went to bed, he changed into his own form, prevented her from screaming, and explained his plight; she promised to help him as long as he respected her honor.  She kept him as a ring by day, and at night would talk with him in human form.
The king fell ill.  Lattantio came and cured him, asking the princess's ring as his reward.  The king summoned Violante, with orders to bring all her jewels, but Violante left behind the ring.  Lattantio realized it was missing and said she could find it.  She returned to her room and wept over the ring.  Dionigi told her that the man was his enemy, and that she should bring the ring and when giving it, throw it against the wall as if in a temper.  When she was finally compelled to bring the ring, she did as he had asked, and the ring became a pomegranate that, when it hit the floor, scattered seeds.  Lattantio became a rooster and ate the seeds to put an end to Dionigi, but one seed hid out of his reach, and when it had a chance, turned to a fox and bit off the rooster's head.  Dionigi told the king the story and with his consent married Violante."
mermaid_of_zennor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_of_Zennor,Mermaid of Zennor,"The Mermaid of Zennor (Cornish: An Vorvoren a Senar) is a popular Cornish folk tale that was first recorded by the Cornish folklorist William Bottrell in 1873.  The legend has inspired works of poetry, literature and art.

","Long ago, a beautiful and richly dressed woman occasionally attended services at St. Senara's Church in Zennor, and sometimes at Morvah.  The parishioners were enchanted by her beauty and her voice, for her singing was sweeter than all the rest.  She appeared infrequently for scores of years, but never seemed to age, and nobody knew whence she came, although they watched her from the summit of Tregarthen Hill.  After many years, the mysterious woman became interested in a young man named Mathey Trewella, ""the best singer in the parish.""  One day he followed her home, and disappeared; neither was ever seen again in Zennor Church.
The villagers wondered what had become of the two, until one Sunday a ship cast anchor about a mile from Pendour Cove.  Soon after, a mermaid appeared, and asked that the anchor be raised, as one of its flukes was resting on her door, and she was unable to reach her children.  The sailors obliged, and quickly set sail, believing the mermaid to be an ill omen.  But when the villagers heard of this, they concluded that the mermaid was the same lady who had long visited their church, and that she had enticed Mathey Trewella to come and live with her.The parishioners at St. Senara's commemorated the story by having one end of a bench carved in the shape of a mermaid.  A shorter account of the legend was related to Bottrell on a subsequent visit to Cornwall.  The mermaid had come to church every Sunday to hear the choir sing, and her own voice was so sweet that she enticed Mathey Trewella, son of the churchwarden, to come away with her; neither was seen again on dry land.  The famed ""mermaid chair"" was the same bench on which the mermaid had sat and sung, opposite Trewella in the singing loft."

The boy kept the sheep out of the elves' meadows, but one day, while he played the flute, one strayed over, and others followed.  When he tried to drive them back, elves appeared and he had to play the flute for them to dance.  They let him go at night but insisted he come back the next day.
Next evening, he dropped the flute and stepped on it, and lamented it, telling the elves that it was made from the heart of a cherry tree.  The elves offered another cherry tree.  He chopped the tree, tricked them into putting their fingers in, and pulled the ax out, so that they were trapped.  They told him where to find Mogarzea's soul, and he brought it back to him.  Then he and Mogarzea brought the tree with the elves back to Mogarzea's father's court.
At court, the boy asked Mogarzea how to marry a fairy of Sweet Milk Lake.  Mogarzea told him.  He went to the lake and played the flute.  A fairy appeared and danced.  On the third day, he plucked the rose from her hair and did not give it back, however she pled; so she married him at the emperor's court.  But every year they and their children went back to Sweet Milk Lake to bathe."

","A hawker wanted to marry a widow's young daughter, but she did not want to marry him.  The widow, who was spinning a coat for her, told her to ask for a white satin dress with gold sprigs, which must fit her exactly.  The girl did so, and three days later, the hawker brought it.  The girl asked her mother, and at her instruction, asked the hawker for a dress the colour of all the birds of the air, which must fit her exactly. When he brought that, she asked for silver slippers, which must fit her exactly.  Then her mother told him to come the next day, at ten, to get his answer.  That morning, the mother gave her the coat, which she had made of moss and gold thread, and which would let her move somewhere else by wishing and also to change herself into any form by wishing.  Then she sent her to the great hall to work.
She tried to get a job as a cook, but they had a cook, so the lady offered to hire her to help the cook as the undercook.  She took it, but the servants would not stand it, being jealous of her beauty and her getting such a position when she left the road; instead, they made her clean dishes and hit her on the head with the skimmer.
A dance came up, and the servants jeered at the idea that she might go.  The young master, who had seen how beautiful she was, asked her if she wanted to go, but she said she was too dirty, even when the master and mistress pressed her as well.  That night, she put all the other servants magically asleep, washed, put on the white satin dress, and used the mossycoat to go to the ball.  The young master fell in love with her, but she said only that she came from a place where people hit her on the head with the skimmer, and when the ball was over, she used the mossycoat to go back.  She woke all the servants and hinted she might have to tell the mistress about their sleeping, so they treated her better.  When the story came of the grand lady at the ball, they went back to abusing her.
Another ball came, and this time, she went in the other dress.  The young master tried to catch her, and perhaps touched her shoe; at any rate, it came off.  He made every woman try to put on the shoe, and when he heard that Mossycoat alone had not tried it, he sent for her too.  The shoe fit her.  The master and mistress turned off the servants for hitting her with the skimmer, and the young master and Mossycoat married."
frau_holle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Hulda,Frau Holle,"""Frau Holle"" ( HOL; also known as ""Mother Holle"", ""Mother Hulda"" or ""Old Mother Frost"") is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in Children's and Household Tales in 1812 (KHM 24). It is of Aarne-Thompson type 480.Frau Holle (also known in various regions as Holla, Holda, Perchta, Berchta, Berta, or Bertha) was initially a pre-Christian female legendary figure who survived in popular belief well into the 19th century.The name may be cognate of the Scandinavian creature known as the Hulder. Jacob Grimm made an attempt to establish her as a Germanic goddess.

","A rich widow lived with her daughter and her stepdaughter. The widow favored her younger biological daughter, allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and spin beside the well.
One day, she pricked her finger on the point of the spindle. As she leaned over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in panic she leapt into the well after it.
The girl found herself in a meadow, where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's peel, she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile before continuing on her way. Finally, she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.
The woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.
After a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that, when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of gold fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house.
Her mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of pitch spilled over her. ""That is what you have earned"", said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.
Other versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks, whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips every time she speaks; compare Diamonds and Toads."
tawara_t_da_monogatari,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lord_Bag_of_Rice,Tawara Tōda Monogatari,"The Tale of Tawara Tōda (俵藤太物語, Tawara Tōda monogatari) is a Japanese heroic tale recounting the legendary exploits of Fujiwara no Hidesato. It is part of the otogi-zōshi genre of tales dating to the Edo Period or earlier. Some of the fabulous accounts are also told in the military pseudo-chronicle, Taiheiki (14th century).
He used bow and arrow to kill a giant centipede (mukade) which wrapped around a mountain near Lake Biwa, fulfilling  
the request of a serpent at a bridge, which turned out to be a court lady (or Dragon King) from the underwater Ryūgū-jō (龍宮城) ""Dragon Palace"". The hero was entertained at the palace and received rewards including armor and sword, and an inexhaustible bag of rice.""My Lord Bag-O'-Rice""  is English-translated title of Basil Hall Chamberlain's retelling, published as a fairy tale (1887). This was later followed by Yei Theodora Ozaki's translation ""My Lord Bag of Rice"" (1903) based on Iwaya Sazanami's retelling.

","The hero's centipede-slaying legend as contained in the Tawara Tōda monogatari (""The Tale of Tawara Tōda"") was widely circulated and read during the early Edo Period (17th century), when the text was being copied in picture scrolls (emaki) and appearing in Otogizōshi type woodblock-printed (and hand-copied) books. A summary of the monogatari version is as follows:

The monogatari version probably derives from earlier accounts of Hidesato's centipede slaying described in the 14th-century Taiheiki, expanded with layers of legendary and religious (Buddhist) motifs. The above summary is not the entirety of Tawara Tōda monogatari, which contains a second part where the hero triumphs over Taira no Masakado, despite the latter having an iron body which was invulnerable except at the temples on his head, and having six ghostly doubles of himself."
odyssey,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey#Return_to_Ithaca_(books_13-20),Odyssey,"The Odyssey (; Ancient Greek: Ὀδύσσεια, romanized: Odýsseia, Attic Greek: [o.dýs.seː.a]) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is one of the oldest extant works of literature still widely read by modern audiences. As with the Iliad, the poem is divided into 24 books. It follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his journey home after the Trojan War. After the war, which lasted ten years, his journey lasted for ten additional years, during which time he encountered many perils and all his crew mates were killed. In his absence, Odysseus was assumed dead, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus had to contend with a group of unruly suitors who were competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.
The Odyssey was originally composed in Homeric Greek in around the 8th or 7th century BCE and, by the mid-6th century BCE, had become part of the Greek literary canon. In antiquity, Homer's authorship of the poem was not questioned, but contemporary scholarship predominantly assumes that the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed independently and that the stories formed as part of a long oral tradition. Given widespread illiteracy, the poem was performed by an aoidos or rhapsode and was more likely to be heard than read.
Crucial themes in the poem include the ideas of nostos (νόστος; ""return""), wandering, xenia (ξενία; ""guest-friendship""), testing, and omens. Scholars still reflect on the narrative significance of certain groups in the poem, such as women and slaves, who have a more prominent role in the epic than in many other works of ancient literature. This focus is especially remarkable when contrasted with the Iliad, which centres the exploits of soldiers and kings during the Trojan War.
The Odyssey is regarded as one of the most significant works of the Western canon. The first English translation of the Odyssey was in the 16th century. Adaptations and re-imaginings continue to be produced across a wide variety of media. In 2018, when BBC Culture polled experts around the world to find literature's most enduring narrative, the Odyssey topped the list.","The Odyssey begins after the end of the ten-year Trojan War (the subject of the Iliad), from which Odysseus (also known by the Latin variant Ulysses), king of Ithaca, has still not returned because he angered Poseidon, the god of the sea. Odysseus' son, Telemachus, is about 20 years old and is sharing his absent father's house on the island of Ithaca with his mother Penelope and the suitors of Penelope, a crowd of 108 boisterous young men who each aim to persuade Penelope for her hand in marriage, all the while reveling in the king's palace and eating up his wealth.

Odysseus' protectress, the goddess Athena, asks Zeus, king of the gods, to finally allow Odysseus to return home when Poseidon is absent from Mount Olympus. Disguised as a chieftain named Mentes, Athena visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father. He offers her hospitality, and they observe the suitors dining rowdily while Phemius, the bard, performs a narrative poem for them.

That night, Athena, disguised as Telemachus, finds a ship and crew for the true prince. The next morning, Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca to discuss what should be done with the insolent suitors, who then scoff at Telemachus. Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as Mentor), the son of Odysseus departs for the Greek mainland to the household of Nestor, most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, who resided in Pylos after the war.

From there, Telemachus rides to Sparta, accompanied by Nestor's son. There he finds Menelaus and Helen, who are now reconciled. Both Helen and Menelaus also say that they returned to Sparta after a long voyage by way of Egypt. There, on the island of Pharos, Menelaus encounters the old sea-god Proteus, who tells him that Odysseus was a captive of the nymph Calypso. Telemachus learns the fate of Menelaus' brother, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and leader of the Greeks at Troy: he was murdered on his return home by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. The story briefly shifts to the suitors, who have only just realized that Telemachus is gone. Angry, they formulate a plan to ambush his ship and kill him as he sails back home. Penelope overhears their plot and worries for her son's safety.

In the course of Odysseus' seven years as a captive of Calypso on the island Ogygia, she has fallen deeply in love with him, even though he spurns her offers of immortality as her husband and still mourns for home. She is ordered to release him by the messenger god Hermes, who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea. Odysseus builds a raft and is given clothing, food, and drink by Calypso. When Poseidon learns that Odysseus has escaped, he wrecks the raft, but helped by a veil given by the sea nymph Ino, Odysseus swims ashore on Scherie, the island of the Phaeacians. Naked and exhausted, he hides in a pile of leaves and falls asleep.

The next morning, awakened by girls' laughter, he sees the young Nausicaä, who has gone to the seashore with her maids after Athena told her in a dream to do so. He appeals for help. She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents, Arete and Alcinous. Alcinous promises to provide him a ship to return him home without knowing the identity of Odysseus. He remains for several days. Odysseus asks the blind singer Demodocus to tell the story of the Trojan Horse, a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity. He then tells the story of his return from Troy.

Odysseus recounts his story to the Phaeacians. After a failed raid, Odysseus and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms. Odysseus visited the lotus-eaters who gave his men their fruit that caused them to forget their homecoming. Odysseus had to drag them back to the ship by force.

Afterwards, Odysseus and his men landed on a lush, uninhabited island near the land of the Cyclopes. The men entered the cave of Polyphemus, where they found all the cheeses and meat they desired. Upon returning to his cave, Polyphemus sealed the entrance with a massive boulder and proceeded to eat Odysseus' men. Odysseus devised an escape plan in which he, identifying himself as ""Nobody,"" plied Polyphemus with wine and blinded him with a wooden stake. When Polyphemus cried out, his neighbors left after Polyphemus claimed that ""Nobody"" had attacked him. Odysseus and his men finally escaped the cave by hiding on the underbellies of the sheep as they were let out of the cave.

As they escaped, however, Odysseus taunted Polyphemus and revealed himself. The Cyclops prayed to his father Poseidon, asking him to curse Odysseus to wander for ten years. After the escape, Aeolus gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds except the west wind, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home. Just as Ithaca came into sight, the sailors opened the bag while Odysseus slept, thinking it contained gold. The winds flew out, and the storm drove the ships back the way they had come. Aeolus, recognizing that Odysseus had drawn the ire of the gods, refused to further assist him.

After the cannibalistic Laestrygonians destroyed all of his ships except his own, Odysseus sailed on and reached the island of Aeaea, home of witch-goddess Circe. She turned half of his men into swine with drugged cheese and wine. Hermes warned Odysseus about Circe and gave Odysseus an herb called moly, making him resistant to Circe's magic. Odysseus forced Circe to change his men back to their human form and was seduced by her. They remained with her for one year. Finally, guided by Circe's instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbour at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead. Odysseus summoned the spirit of the prophet Tiresias and was told that he may return home if he is able to stay himself and his crew from eating the sacred livestock of Helios on the island of Thrinacia and that failure to do so would result in the loss of his ship and his entire crew.

Returning to Aeaea, they buried Elpenor and were advised by Circe on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirted the land of the Sirens. All of the sailors had their ears plugged up with beeswax, except for Odysseus, who was tied to the mast as he wanted to hear the song. He told his sailors not to untie him as it would only make him drown himself. They then passed between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis. Scylla claimed six of his men.

Next, they landed on the island of Thrinacia, with the crew overriding Odysseus's wishes to remain away from the island. Zeus caused a storm which prevented them from leaving, causing them to deplete the food given to them by Circe. While Odysseus was away praying, his men ignored the warnings of Tiresias and Circe and hunted the sacred cattle. Helios insisted that Zeus punish the men for this sacrilege. They suffered a shipwreck, and all but Odysseus drowned as he clung to a fig tree. Washed ashore on Ogygia, he remained there as Calypso's lover.

Having listened to his story, the Phaeacians agree to provide Odysseus with more treasure than he would have received from the spoils of Troy. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca. Odysseus awakens and believes that he has been dropped on a distant land before Athena appears to him and reveals that he is indeed on Ithaca. She hides his treasure in a nearby cave and disguises him as an elderly beggar so he can see how things stand in his household. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own slaves, swineherd Eumaeus, who treats him hospitably and speaks favorably of Odysseus. After dinner, the disguised Odysseus tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself.

Telemachus sails home from Sparta, evading an ambush set by the suitors. He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and meets Odysseus. Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but not to Eumaeus), and they decide that the suitors must be killed. Telemachus goes home first. Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus returns to his own house, still pretending to be a beggar. He is ridiculed by the suitors in his own home, especially Antinous. Odysseus meets Penelope and tests her intentions by saying he once met Odysseus in Crete. Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus's recent wanderings.

Odysseus's identity is discovered by the housekeeper Eurycleia when she recognizes an old scar as she is washing his feet. Eurycleia tries to tell Penelope about the beggar's true identity, but Athena makes sure that Penelope cannot hear her. Odysseus swears Eurycleia to secrecy.

The next day, at Athena's prompting, Penelope maneuvers the suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus' bow. The man who can string the bow and shoot an arrow through a dozen axe heads would win. Odysseus takes part in the competition, and he alone is strong enough to string the bow and shoot the arrow through the dozen axe heads, making him the winner. He then throws off his rags and kills Antinous with his next arrow. Odysseus kills the other suitors, first using the rest of the arrows and then by swords and spears. Once the battle is won, Telemachus also hangs twelve of their household maids whom Eurycleia identifies as guilty of betraying Penelope or having sex with the suitors. Odysseus identifies himself to Penelope. She is hesitant but recognizes him when he mentions that he made their bed from an olive tree still rooted to the ground."

","A peasant's wife and the parson fancied each other, so the wife feigned illness, and the parson preached that whoever had an ill family member could go to the Cuckoo's Mountain in Italy, and get laurel leaves that would cure the ill person.  The peasant, Hildebrand, left to get them, and the parson came to his house.  But on the way, Hildebrand met his cousin, an egg merchant, who alerted him and brought him to the house in his cart. The parson and the wife began to sing, the merchant sang, and Hildebrand sang that it was enough.  He jumped from the basket and beat the parson out of the house."
old_sultan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Sultan,Old Sultan,"""Old Sultan"" (German: Der alte Sultan) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 48).The tale combines two different Aarne–Thompson-Uther types: ATU 101 (""The Old Dog as Rescuer of the Child"") and ATU 103 (""War between Wild Animals and Domestic Animals""). The motif of ""The War Between the Village Animals and the Forest Animals"", formerly classified as AT 104, was merged with ATU 103 in Hans-Jörg Uther's new classification system in 2004. Another example of ATU 103 tale is the Bohemian ""The Dog and the Wolf"".

","Sultan is the faithful dog of a farmer, but has now grown old. One day the farmer tells his wife he would kill Sultan because he has lost most of his teeth and seems useless as a guard dog. His wife begs him to reconsider, telling him how loyal Sultan has been to them for many years, but the farmer's mind is made up. Sultan hears and is very upset. He goes off to the woods to see his good friend the wolf. The wolf has an idea to save Sultan's life and tells him him that they would take their child haying the next day, and the wolf would carry him off. Sultan could chase him, and he would free the child. Seeing their child safely returned, the farmer and his wife would be grateful and not kill Sultan.
The wolf's plan succeeds, and the farmer was so grateful that he has his wife make Sultan some bread special soup and also he gives him a special cushion to sleep on.
The wolf then  comes to visit Sultan and asks him to overlook him stealing the sheep. Sultan refuses, saying that he can't disobey his master, but the wolf thinks he's only jesting. That same night, the wolf tries to steal a sheep from the farm, but Sultan warns the farmer who then drives the wolf away. Thinking that Sultan has double-crossed him, the wolf vows revenge.
The next morning, the wolf goes to see another of his friends, the boar and asks him to go and challenge Sultan to a fight in the woods. Sultan accepts the challenge, but can only find a three-legged cat to help him. As the wolf and boar are waiting, they mistake the cat's upraised tail for a sword and when the cat limped they thought she was picking up rocks to throw. Terrified of this, they hide. The boar is hiding under a bush and has one of his ears bitten by the cat after she mistakes it for a mouse. The boar runs away and tells Sultan and the cat that the wolf who has hidden himself in the branches of a tree is the one they want.
The two urge the wolf to climb down and surrender, which he does. The wolf feels extremely guilty for his actions and asks Sultan to forgive him, which he does and they become good friends again."
penta_of_the_chopped_off_hands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penta_of_the_Chopped-off_Hands,Penta of the Chopped-off Hands,"Penta of the Chopped-off Hands or The Girl With the Maimed Hands is an Italian literary fairy tale written by Giambattista Basile in his 1634 work, the Pentamerone.It is Aarne-Thompson type 706B, ""The Girl without Hands.""  The Brothers Grimm cited it as an analog to The Girl Without Hands.  Other variants of this tale include The One-Handed Girl, The Armless Maiden, and Biancabella and the Snake.

","A king lost his wife and fell in love with his sister, Penta.  He implored her to marry him.  When she refused and he continued to implore her, she asked what attracted him, and he praised her beauty, but most highly, her hands.  She tricked a slave into cutting off her hands, and the king had her put in a chest and thrown into the sea.  A fisherman caught the chest in his nets and brought her home, but his wife, Nuccia, was jealous of Penta's beauty and threw her back into the sea.  The king of Terraverde saw the chest and rescued her, making her his queen's lady-in-waiting.  Shortly thereafter, the queen fell ill and asked him to marry Penta.  He agreed, she died, and he married Penta.  He had to go on a journey, and while he was gone, Penta gave birth to a baby.  The king's servants sent a message, but the ship was thrown by a storm on the shore where the fisherman had rescued Penta, and Nuccia got the captain drunk and substituted a letter that said she had given birth to a puppy.  The king received this message and sent back a letter that the queen should not be distressed, such events were determined by heaven, but Nuccia substituted a letter ordering that the queen and her son were to be burned.  His councilors concluded that he had gone mad and sent Penta and her son away.  She traveled to a kingdom ruled by a magician, who gave her shelter and promised a reward to whoever could tell him the most miserable tale.
The king returned home, heard all the stories, and concluded that Nuccia had caused the problems.  He went to her home and had her burned.  He heard of the magician's offer from Penta's brother and was certain that he could win the prize.  They both went, and Penta's brother recounted his wickedness and how he had thrown his own sister into the sea.  Penta's husband recounted his tale.  The magician showed them Penta and her son, and declared that her husband had suffered the most miserably, so that Penta and her husband would be his heirs."
pentamerone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentamerone,Pentamerone,"The Pentamerone, subtitled Lo cunto de li cunti (""The Tale of Tales""), is a seventeenth-century Neapolitan fairy tale collection by Italian poet and courtier Giambattista Basile.

","The name of the Pentamerone comes from Greek πέντε [pénte], ‘five’, and ἡμέρα [hêméra], ‘day’. It is structured around a fantastic frame story, in which fifty stories are related over the course of five days, in analogy with the ten-day structure of the much earlier Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio (1353). The frame story is that of a cursed, melancholy princess named Zoza (""mud"" or ""slime"" in Neapolitan, but also used as a term of endearment). She cannot laugh, no matter what her father does to amuse her, so he sets up a fountain of oil by the door, thinking people slipping in the oil would make her laugh. An old woman tried to gather oil, a page boy broke her jug, and the old woman grew so angry that she danced about, and Zoza laughed at her. The old woman cursed her to marry only the prince of Round-Field, whom she could only wake by filling a pitcher with tears in three days. With some aid from fairies, who also give her gifts, Zoza found the prince and the pitcher, and nearly filled the pitcher when she fell asleep. A Moorish slave steals it, finishes filling it, and claims the prince.
This frame story in itself is a fairy tale, combining motifs that will appear in other stories: the princess who cannot laugh in The Magic Swan, Golden Goose, and The Princess Who Never Smiled; the curse to marry only one hard-to-find person, in Snow-White-Fire-Red and Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa; and the heroine falling asleep while trying to save the hero, and then losing him because of trickery in The Sleeping Prince and Nourie Hadig.
The now-pregnant slave-princess demands (at the impetus of Zoza's fairy gifts) that her husband tell her stories, or else she would crush the unborn child. The husband hires ten female storytellers to keep her amused; disguised among them is Zoza. Each tells five stories, most of which are more suitable to courtly, rather than juvenile, audiences. The Moorish woman's treachery is revealed in the final story (related, suitably, by Zoza), and she is buried, pregnant, up to her neck in the ground and left to die. Zoza and the Prince live happily ever after.

pied_piper_of_hamelin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin,Pied Piper of Hamelin,"The Pied Piper of Hamelin (German: der Rattenfänger von Hameln, also known as the Pan Piper or the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the title character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany.
The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (""pied"") clothing, who was a rat catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service as promised, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others. The phrase ""pied piper"" has become a metaphor for a person who attracts a following through charisma or false promises.There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.

The earliest known record of the story originates from the town of Hamelin itself, depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around 1300. Although the church was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts of the tale have survived.","In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored (""pied"") clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats (according to some versions of the story, the promised sum was 1,000 guilders). The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where they all drowned.Despite the piper's success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to a sum of 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul's day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned, dressed in green like a hunter and playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town's children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave, after which they were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and therefore unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.Other versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land, or a place called Koppenberg Mountain, or Transylvania, or that he made them walk into the Weser as he did with the rats, and they all drowned. Some versions state that the Piper returned the children after extorting payment, or that the children were only returned after the villagers paid several times the original payment in gold.The Hamelin street named Bungelosenstrasse (""street without drums"") is believed to be the last place that the children were seen. Ever since, music or dancing is not allowed on this street."
pintosmalto,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintosmalto,Pintosmalto,"Pintosmalto or Pinto Smauto is an Italian literary fairy tale written by Giambattista Basile in his 1634 work, the Pentamerone.Italo Calvino included a variant from oral tradition, The Handmade King, based on two tales from Calabria.  He noted that variants are also found in Naples, Abruzzo, and Sicily.It is Aarne-Thompson type 425, the search for the lost bridegroom, in an unusual variation, involving motifs similar to Pygmalion and Galatea.

","A merchant's daughter, Betta, continually refused to marry.  One day, he asked her what she wanted him to bring her after a journey.  She asked for large amounts of sugar and sweet almonds, scented water, musk and amber, various jewels, gold thread, and above all a trough and a silver trowel.  Extravagant though it was, he brought it.
She took it and made a statue of it, and prayed to the Goddess of Love, and the statue became a living man.  She took him to her father and told him she wished to marry him.  At the wedding feast, a queen fell in love with Pintosmalto, and because he was still innocent, tricked him into coming with her.  When Betta could not find him, she set out.  An old woman sheltered her for a night and taught her three sayings to use.  Betta went on, and found the city Round Mount, where the queen kept Pintosmalto.  She used the first of the sayings; it conjured up a jeweled coach, and she bribed the queen to let her spend the night at Pintosmalto's door.  The queen drugged Pintosmalto into sleep that night.  Betta's pleadings went unheard.  She used the second; it conjured up a golden cage with a singing bird of jewels and gold, and it went with it as with the coach.
The next day, Pintosmalto went to the garden, and a cobbler who lived nearby and had heard everything told him about the lamenting woman.  Betta used the third saying, which conjured up marvelous clothes, and won her a third night.  Pintosmalto roused at her account of her sufferings and how she had made him; he took everything the queen had taken from Betta, and some jewels and money in recompense for her injuries, and they fled to her father's home."

The themes of marriage to the monstrous or mysterious husband, of curiosity inspired by the mother, and even the drops of spilled tallow are very similar to the Hellenistic romance of Cupid and Psyche.","A king has three daughters. One day, he wants to go to the fair, and promises to bring his daughters a present. After much insistence, the youngest asks for the ""three singing leaves"".
The king goes to the fair and has no luck in finding the requested item, until he wanders off and follows a melodious sound to a hazel-bush containing three golden leaves that produce sounds. The king approaches the hazel-bush to pluck the leaves, but a voice stops him, saying that the leaves belong to ""Prince Hatt under the Earth"".
The king makes a deal with the voice: he can take the leaves, but has to promise to deliver to Prince Hatt the first thing that greets the king on his returns. So he brings the leaves home and his youngest daughter welcomes him. Because of his rash promise, the king has to give his daughter to Prince Hat under the Ground.
The princess goes to Prince Hat's lair and spends the days all alone in his subterranean abode, but when night falls, he returns and he is always tender and caring.
The problem is that she has promised him never to see his face. Three years pass and she has three children. She increasingly becomes less lonely and happier. Three years in a row, she visits her father's castle, when he remarries and her two sisters marry. However, the king's new consort makes her believe that she has to see her husband's face, because he might be a troll. At the third visit, her stepmother gives her a wax candle that she is to hold over her sleeping husband to see his face. To her happy surprise, she sees a beautiful young man, but a drop of wax falls onto his chest. He wakes up in horror, but now he is blind and the abode has turned into a hollow of toads and snakes.

prince_hyacinth_and_the_dear_little_princess,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Hyacinth_and_the_Dear_Little_Princess,Prince Hyacinth and the Dear Little Princess,"Prince Hyacinth and the Dear Little Princess, a French fairy tale, is the second story in Andrew Lang's The Blue Fairy Book.

","Prince Hyacinth is born to a widowed Queen. He is a beautiful baby, except for his nose- the very largest ever seen. Unknown to either the Queen or any of her court, this giant nose had been foretold before his parents' marriage.
Prince Hyacinth's father, the King, had sought the help of the Fairy to win the Princess when his courtship failed. Taking pity on the distraught suitor, she told him the secret of breaking the spell that prevented the Princess from marrying: step on the tail of the Princess' great cat. As soon as the King managed to get his foot squarely on the cat's tail, the animal transformed into an angry wizard, who tried to dampen the King's joy. ""You will have a son who will be horribly unhappy"", the enchanter taunted, ""a Prince made miserable because he will not know of the enormity of his own nose"". The King was more confounded than worried by this prediction. After all, how could anyone not know the appearance of his own nose?
Sure enough, the prince grew to be a man with no idea that he had an unusual facial feature. From the moment of his birth, his mother and everyone at court went to great lengths to imply that the length of his nose was not only normal but desirable. Only children with extra-long noses were allowed to play with him, courtiers pulled on their own noses to make them appear longer, his history tutor took pains to describe any handsome or beautiful personage as having had a particularly long nose.
When he became of age, Prince Hyacinth was shown a portrait of a dear little Princess. Falling in love with her instantly, he still had to admit that her nose was extremely small and tilted. His mother, pleased with the match, re-assured him that small noses are actually not considered so ugly in women. Ambassadors were sent to ask the neighboring King for the Dear Little Princess' hand in marriage.

Consent was given, and the joyful Prince travelled to meet her. As he approached, ready to kiss her hand, the Sorcerer appeared and whisked her away.
The Prince ordered his entourage of courtiers to leave him and wandered, disconsolate. For the first time in his life, he was alone. He meets the Fairy, a little old woman who takes quite some time adjusting her spectacles to look him over. Her nose is too short to easily secure the glasses, and they repeatedly fall off. Regarding each other, each bursts into laughter. The Prince is stunned to find the Fairy thinks his nose is ridiculous. He sees that everyone flatters her and assumes they have deceived her into believing her tiny nose is not a fault. How foolish some people are, he thinks, not to see the reality of their own character. At dinner, which he is very glad to get, his hunger prompts him to put up with her repeated observations about the length of his nose. Finally, he asks her to stop mentioning his nose. She agrees, promising that she will not only stop talking about it, she will even try to believe he has an ordinary nose, though clearly it could make three reasonable sized ones. With that, the Prince has had enough and rides off. Everywhere he goes, searching for the Dear Little Princess, he meets people who claim that his nose is abnormally large. He thinks them all mad.
The old Fairy, who had been so fond of his father, helps Prince Hyacinth. She shuts the Dear Little Princess in a crystal palace and places the palace where the Prince will find it. With great joy, he sets to work to free her, but cannot get through its walls. The Dear Little Princess extends her hand through a window for him to kiss it, but he cannot manage to get his lips past his nose to touch her hand, no matter how he turns or twists. For the first time, he realizes just how long that nose really is, too long!
With that realization, the crystal palace shattered into splinters and the old Fairy presented the Dear Little Princess to him with the admonition, ""You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects. We refuse to see them until we find them in the way of our interests.""
Prince Hyacinth's nose shrinks down to a usual size and he marries the Dear Little Princess. The two live happily ever after."

prince_ring,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Ring,Prince Ring,"""Prince Ring"" (Icelandic: Sagan af Hríngi kóngssyni) is an Icelandic folktale, collected by Jón Árnason.
Andrew Lang translated the tale into English as ""Prince Ring"" in The Yellow Fairy Book (1894).

","A prince named Ring (Icelandic: Hríngur) and his men hunted a hind with a golden ring on its horns. A darkness came over them, and they lost the hind and their way, and separated because they each thought they knew better the way back home. The prince came upon a woman on the seashore, next to a barrel. He saw a golden ring in the barrel, and mentioned it. The woman said he might have it if he took it out; when he bent over, she pushed him in, fastened the top, and threw it into the sea. It drifted a time, but hit against rocks. He guessed he was near land, kicked out the top, and swam ashore. A giant found him there and took him home to his wife. One day, the giant showed him everything of the house but the parlour. When the giant was gone, he tried to look in  As soon as he did, something within moved and tried to speak, frightening him off.  He tried two more times, and the third was brave enough to see a great black dog, and that it said, ""Choose me, Prince Ring.""
Sometime later, the giant said that he did not have long to live, and so would carry him back to the mainland. He offered the prince anything to take with him; the prince chose what was in the parlour. Surprised, the giant nevertheless gave him the dog and took him to shore in a stone boat, telling him at the end that he could claim the island in two weeks, in which time he and his wife would be dead. The prince and dog walked on. The dog told him he was not curious, since he did not ask his name; the prince asked, and the dog said to call it ""Snati-Snati"". Then they came to a castle, and the dog told him to take service and get a little room for them both.
The king quickly esteemed Ring. A counsellor named Red told him that it was odd, when Ring had done so little. The king set both Ring and Red to cutting trees; Ring took two axes, and Snati-Snati cut as well, so that they cut more than twice what Red cut. Growing more jealous, Red said that the king should get Ring to kill and flay the wild oxen in the woods. Finally, the king sent him. There were two, and Snati-Snati took the larger and Ring the smaller, with some help from the dog. The king highly favored him after this.
Red persuaded him to set Ring to find the gold cloak, chess-board, and piece that the king had lost a year ago. The king added that if he found them before Christmas, he could marry the king's daughter. Snati-Snati told him to get all the salt he could, and then carried it as they set out.  The dog helped him up a cliff, and they came to a hut. Four trolls slept, and the porridge pot was on the fire. Snati-Snati told Ring to pour all the salt into the pot. When the trolls woke, the old hag ate first and complained that she had stolen milk from seven kingdoms and now it was salt. After they ate, the old one became thirsty and sent her daughter to fetch water, but the daughter would not unless the old hag gave her the gold piece. The daughter took it and went, but when she bent to drink, the prince and dog pushed her in. The hag grew thirstier, and sent her son, though he demanded the golden cloak; he met the same fate as his sister. Finally, she sent her husband, though he demanded the golden chessboard; he met the same fate as his children, but when the prince and dog went back to the cottage, his ghost followed them. They had to wrestle with it and defeat it a second time. At the cottage, Snati-Snati said they had to go inside, once the hag got out they could not defeat her, but he would attack with a red-hot iron from the fire and the prince must pour boiling porridge over her, and by those means, they defeated her. They returned to the king late Christmas night. The king was well pleased, but the dog asked Prince Ring to trade places for the night:  he would sleep in the prince's bed, and the prince where he usually slept. Ring agreed, but after a time, the dog sent him to his own bed, with instructions not to meddle with anything about it.
In the morning, Red went to the king, with his hand cut off, and demanded justice, but Ring showed him the bed, where the hand still held a sword. The king hanged Red and married Ring to his daughter. Snati-Snati asked to sleep at the foot of the bed, their wedding night; Ring granted this, and in the morning, saw a prince sleeping there, with an ugly dogskin beside him. Ring burned the dogskin and woke the prince. This prince was also named Ring.  His father had married a woman who was a witch and who had cursed him into that shape until a prince of his name let him sleep at his feet his wedding night. This stepmother had been the hind he had hunted, and the woman who had pushed him into the barrel, for fear that the curse would be broken. After the witch was killed, they divided the trolls' treasure, and Ring married the other Ring to his sister, giving him his father's kingdom, while he stayed with his father-in-law and had half the kingdom and the whole after his death."

princess_belle_etoile,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Belle-Etoile,Princess Belle-Etoile,"Princess Belle-Etoile is a French literary fairy tale written by Madame d'Aulnoy. Her source for the tale was Ancilotto, King of Provino, by Giovanni Francesco Straparola.It is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 707 The dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird.

","A queen was reduced to poverty, and to selling sauces to support herself and her three daughters.  One day, an old woman came to them and begged that they feed her a fine meal.  They did so, and the woman, being a fairy, promised that the next time they wished something without thinking of her, it would come true.  For a long time, they could not make a wish without thinking of her, but one day, the king came by.  The oldest daughter, Roussette, said that if she married the king's admiral, she would make sails for all his ships; the second, Brunette, that if she married the king's brother, she would make him lace enough to fill a castle; the third, Blondine, that if she married the king, she would bear him two sons and a daughter, who would have golden chains about their necks and stars on their foreheads, and jewels would fall from their hair.
A favorite repeated their words to the king, who summoned the sisters, and soon the marriages were concluded.  A splendid wedding feast appeared out of nowhere, served on golden dishes, and the women realized it was from the old woman.  Roussette hid the dishes when they left, but they were turned to earthenware when she arrived.
The king's mother was furious to hear that her sons had married such lowly women. Roussette was jealous of her sisters. Brunette gave birth to a son, and died. Blondine gave birth to two sons and a daughter, and the queen and Roussette put three puppies in their place. They took the children, including Brunette's, and gave them to a maid, who scrupled to kill them, but put them in a boat, with necklaces that might pay for their support if someone found them.  The queen was sent back to her mother.
The fairies guarded the boat until it fell in with a pirate ship.  The captain brought them to his childless wife. When they found that jewels fell from the children's hair, the captain gave up his piracy, because he would be rich without it.  They named the princess Belle-Etoile (French for ""Beautiful Star""); her older brother, Petit-Soleil (""Little Sun""); her younger, Heureux (""Happy""); and their cousin, who did not have the chain or star but was more beautiful than his cousins, Chéri (""Darling"").
As Belle-Etoile and Chéri grew up, they fell in love, but believing themselves brother and sister, deeply regretted it.  One day, she overheard the pirate and his wife talking, and learned where they had come from.  She told her brothers and cousin, and they told the pirate and his wife that they wished to leave.  The pirate implored them to stay, but Heureux persuaded him that they wondered too much about their birth to endure it.  They set sail in a marvelous ship.  It arrived at the castle of the king their father, and the king marveled over them.  They asked only for a house in which to stay.
The Queen mother realized from the description that these were her grandchildren. She sent the maid who had failed to drown them, and the woman told Belle-Etoile that she needed the dancing water, which would keep her from ever looking old. She told that story, and Chéri set out at once, against her will. He found a spring and rescued a dove from drowning. It set all sorts of animals that burrow to dig up the dancing water, and Chéri returned with it. He freed the dove and it flew off rather sulkily.

The maid came back with a tale of a singing apple, and Chéri once again set out.  This time, a reading stranger directed him to the apple, and by helping a wounded dove, he gained the knowledge of the dragon that guarded it, and how it could be frightened off by mirrors, and returned with the apple.
The maid returned with a tale of a little green bird that knew everything.  Belle-Etoile was deeply distressed by this, as she realized it could tell her who their parents were, and where they came from. Chéri set out again, but when he had nearly reached the bird, the rock opened, and he fell into a hall and was transformed into stone. Belle-Etoile fell ill from her distress at his absence, and Petit-Soleil set out to find Chéri, but suffered the same fate, and then Heureux did the same.
Belle-Etoile set out after them, and rescued a dove from snow.  It advised her not to climb the mountain where the bird perched, but to sing below it, and lure it down. She did so, and the bird advised her on how to free her brothers and all the rest of the prisoners.
Meanwhile, the Queen Mother had persuaded the king to have his marriage to Blondine set aside, and marry again.  Roussette persuaded the queen to invite Blondine to the wedding.  The king invited the four children, and left a gentleman to await their arrival.  The gentleman, on their arrival, told them the king's story.  Belle-Etoile and her brothers arrived for the wedding, bringing their treasures, told how they were abandoned, and showed them to the king.  Finally, the king asked the green bird who these children were, and where they came from.  The bird proclaimed that they were the king's children and nephew.
The Queen Mother, Roussette, and the maid were all punished, and instead of marrying himself, the king married his daughter Belle-Etoile to Chéri."

He returns to the pool twice, and on the third time princess Himal notices his beauty, and falls in love with him. Himal sends a maid to follow the snake and sees it enter Soda Ram's house.
Princess Himal tells her father she will marry no other than the son of brahman Soda Ram. Soda Ram is called to the king's presence to deal with the wedding arrangements. The king suggests his prospective son-in-law should come in a regal and magnificent wedding procession. Nágray instructs his adoptive father to toss a paper in a certain spring, one hour before the wedding, and the procession will come. Himal and Nágray marry and live in a palace built near a river.
However, Nágray's other wives, which live in the realm of snakes, decide to pay a visit to the human princess, under a magical disguise, due to their lordship's extended absence. One of them uses a disguise of a glass seller to sell her wares to the palace. Nágray finds the utensils and destroys each of them, forbidding his human wife to buy any other. The second snake wife dons the guise of a sweeper. She tells Himal her husband was Nágray, also a sweeper (a man of a lower caste). The false sweeper gives Himal instructions on how to prove his origins: throw him in a spring and, if he sinks, he is not a sweeper.
Himal tells Nágray of the encounter and he admonishes her. But she insists he proves his caste. He enters the spring and slowly sinks in, until he disappears. Himal, then, is left alone and without a husband.  She returns to her palatial home, mounts a caravanserai and begins to give alms to the poor. On one occasion, a poor man and his daughter pay her a visit and tell that, in a jungle, they came across a spring. From this spring, an army marched out and set out a dinner for their king. Soon after, the army returned to the spring and this king gave them some alms, ""in the name of foolish Himal"".
With renewed hope, princess Himal asks the man to guide her to this location. They rest for the night, as Himal, still awake, sees Nágray coming from the spring. She begs him to return to their wedded life together, but Nágray warns of the danger of his snake wives. He turns her into a pebble and takes her to the watery kingdom. The snake wives notice the object and tell their husband to turn it back to human shape.
The snake wives decide to set Himal as their housekeeper. They tell her she must boil the milk for their serpentine children, and to knock the pots down. However, Himal knocks down the pots while the milk is still boiling hot, and, as the serpent children drink the milk, they die. Their serpentine mothers, overwhelmed with grief, turn into serpents and bite Himal. A grieving Nágray places her corpse on top of tree, alternating visits between her resting place and the spring.
One day, a holy man climbs up the tree and sees the corpse of Himal, still beautiful as she was in life. He prays to Náráyan and she returns to life. The holy man takes her to his home. Nágray, noticing its disappearance, begins a search and finds her at the holy man's house. While she was sleeping, Nágray enters the bedroom in his serpentine form and coils around her bedpost. The holy man's son, unaware of the serpent's nature, takes a knife and cuts the serpent into two pieces. Himal awakes startled and sees the serpent's corpse, lamenting her husband's death.
Nágray's corpse is burned, and Himal throws herself into the funeral pyre to die with him. However, deities Shiva and Parvati reunite both lovers by resurrecting their ashes in a magical spring."
princess_rosette,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Rosette,Princess Rosette,"Princess Rosette (French: La Princesse Rosette) is a French literary fairy tale written by Madame d'Aulnoy.  Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.Italo Calvino included an orally collected tale, The King of the Peacocks, in his Italian Folktales, but observed in the notes that it was clearly a variant on Princess Rosette.

","A king and queen, who had two sons, had a daughter as well.  All the fairies came to the christening.  When the queen pressed them to predict Rosette's future, they said that she might cause great misfortune to her brothers, and even their deaths.  The king and queen consulted with a hermit, who advised them to lock Rosette in a tower.  They did so, but one day they died, and their sons instantly freed her from it.  She marveled at everything, but in particular, at a peacock.  When she heard that people sometimes ate them, she declared that she would never marry anyone except the King of the Peacocks, and then she would protect her subjects.
Her brothers, the new king and the prince, set out to find the King of the Peacocks, and at last were directed there by the King of the Mayflies.  There, they showed the king Rosette's portrait.  He said he would marry her if she was as beautiful, but kill them both if she was not.
When the news came, Princess Rosette set out with her nurse.  The nurse bribed the boatman to throw the princess, bed and all, with her little dog, into the sea in the middle of the night. The bed was made of Phoenix feathers and floated, but the nurse put her own daughter in the princess's place.  The outraged king was about to execute her brothers, who persuaded him to give them seven days to prove their innocence.

When the princess woke, she was convinced that the king had decided not to marry her after all, and so had her thrown into the sea.  An old man saw her on the shore and brought her to shelter, but saw by her possessions that she was a great lady, and he could only give her meager fare.  The princess sent her dog to the best kitchen in town, and the dog stole all the food being cooked for the King of the Peacocks.  This happened for several days, until the Prime Minister spied on the kitchen, saw the dog, and followed it.  He told the king, and they went to the hut and seized Rosette and the old man.  The old man begged for mercy and told the story, and the king realized that this was his bride.  He freed her brothers and married her."
puddocky,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puddocky,Puddocky,"""Das Mahrchen von der Padde"" (""The Tale of the Toad"") is a German folktale collected by Johann Gustav Gottlieb Büsching in Volks-Sagen, Märchen und Legenden. It has been translated into English under the titles of ""Puddocky"" or ""Cherry the Frog Bride"".
A similar tale is The Three Feathers, collected by the Brothers Grimm in the nineteenth century.

","The story opens with the heroine, who is so greedy for parsley that her mother steals it for her. As a result, she is called Parsley. The parsley comes from the garden of a neighboring convent run by an abbess. The girl is seen by three princes, and because of her beauty, they quarrel over her. The resentful abbess curses the girl for the commotion, turning her into a toad and sending her far away.. 

The king decides to allow fate to choose his successor from among his three sons. He sets them the task of finding a hundred-yard piece of linen fine enough to fit through a ring. While the two oldest princes choose to follow busier roads and collect bales of linen, the youngest son sets out on a dark and lonely road. He comes into a marsh, where he encounters a toad which offers him the fabric he needs. It exceeds his brothers' discoveries.  The king then sends them out to find a dog that can fit inside a walnut shell.  Again, the toad provides.
For the third task, the king orders them to return with a bride. The one who obtains the most beautiful wife will be king. This time, the toad herself accompanies the youngest prince, riding in a cardboard carriage drawn by rats, with hedgehogs for outriders, a mouse for a coachman, and two frogs as footmen. When they turn a corner, the prince is astonished to see the carriage replaced by a beautiful coach with human attendants, and that the toad has become a beautiful woman whom he recognizes as Parsley. He is selected as the new king, and marries Parsley."
rushen_coatie,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushen_Coatie,Rushen Coatie,"Rushen Coatie or Rashin-Coatie is a Scottish fairy tale collected by Joseph Jacobs in his More English Fairy Tales.
It is Aarne–Thompson type 510A, the persecuted heroine, as is Cinderella.

","A queen with a daughter died. On her deathbed, she told her daughter that a red calf would come to her, and she could ask it for help.
The king remarried to a widow with three daughters, and the girl's stepmother and three stepsisters maltreated her, giving her only a coat made of rushes to wear—calling her Rushen Coatie— and gave her too little food. A red calf came to her, and when she asked for food, it told her to pull it from its ears. The stepmother set one of her daughters to spy on Rushen Coatie, and the girl discovered the red calf.
The stepmother feigned illness and told the king that she needed the sweetbread from the red calf. The king had it slaughtered, but the dead calf told Rushen Coatie to bury its body, and she did, except for the shankbone, which she could not find.
At Yuletide, the stepmother and stepsisters jeered at her for wanting to go to church and set her to make dinner, but the red calf limped into the kitchen.  It gave her clothing to wear and told her a charm to cook the supper.  At church, a young prince fell in love with her.
She went twice more, and the third time, the prince set a watch to stop her, but she jumped over it and a shoe made of glass fell to the ground.
The prince declared he would marry the woman whose foot the shoe matched, and one of her stepsisters hacked off part of her foot to do it, but the blood gave her away.  Then no one had failed to try except Rushen Coatie, so the prince insisted on her trying it, and they married, But soon after it was the end of their marriage."
sadko,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadko,Sadko,"Sadko (Russian: Садко) is the principal character in a Russian medieval epic bylina. He was an adventurer, merchant, and gusli musician from Novgorod.

","Sadko of Novgorod played the gusli on the shores of a lake and river. The Tsar of the Sea enjoyed his music, and offered to help him. Sadko was instructed to make a bet with the local merchants about catching a gold-finned fish in the lake; when he caught it (as provided by the Sea Tsar), the merchants had to pay the wager, making Sadko a rich merchant.

Sadko traded on the seas with his new wealth, but did not pay proper respects to the Tsar as per their agreement.  The Tsar stopped Sadko's ships in the sea.  He and his sailors tried to appease the Sea Tsar with gold, to no avail. Sadko realizes a sacrifice of a live soul was being demanded. All the shipmates drew lots, but Sadko draws the unlucky lot as if by fate or magic, so he is sent overboard and he sinks into the sea.In the sea world, Sadko played the gusli for the Sea Tsar, whose dancing roughened the seas, so that all the sailors prayed to Mikola Mozhaisky (Mikula Mozhaysk, patron of mariners; or the name Saint Nicholas is called by in variants), and the saint instructed Sadko to quit playing, and break the strings if the Tsar will not let him stop. As the Tsar was bound to offer him a choice of maidens to wed in order to detain him, Mikola advised him to choose the last one, with the warning not to embrace her as a wife (consummate the marriage) if he hoped ever to return to Russia. The Tsar showed Sadko a selection of 900 (or 300) maidens, and Sadko picked out Chernava (diminutive: Chernavushka) who appeared last. The two then wed, but the groom made no overture to the bride on their wedding night, and Sadko the next day woke up in his hometown, reunited with his terrestrial wife.The Chernava is explained as the nymph of the River Chernava. In Ransom's version, the Sea Tsar's youngest daughter is named Volkhov, which is the river Sadko has always cherished."
shippeitaro,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippeitaro,Shippeitaro,"Shippeitaro or Shippei Taro (also given by the German spelling Schippeitaro) (しっぺい太郎, 竹篦太郎, 悉平太郎, 執柄太郎) is the name of a helper dog in the Japanese fairy tale by the same name.
Translations include ""Schippeitaro"" in Andrew Lang's Violet Fairy Book (1901), taken from a German copy, and Mrs. James's ""Schippeitaro"" (1888), which share the same plotline: The mountain spirit and its minions (in the guise of cats in this version) demand a yearly human sacrifice of a maiden from the local village. A young warrior overhears the spirits hinting that their would-be bane was ""Shippeitaro"", which turns out to be a dog. This dog is substituted for the maiden to be placed inside the sacrificial container, and when the spirits arrive, the warrior and dog attack the cats and vanquish them.
The evil spirits appear as monkeys in most instances of the tale, as in the version of ""Shippei Taro"" given in  Keigo Seki's anthology (translated into English 1963). In fact, this folktale is classified as ""Destroying the Monkey Demon"" (Sarugami taiji) tale type by Japanese folklorists.
In variants, the dog may have Suppeitarō, Suppetarō or a variety of other names, for example, ""Hayatarō of Kōzenji temple in Shinano"". The dog may not be given any name at all.
Monkey God tales preserved in the medieval anthologies Konjaku Monogatarishū and Uji Shūi Monogatari have been suggested as being the original sources of the orally disseminated versions.

","Below is the summary of the Lang/Mrs. James version:A young adventure-seeking warrior entered an enchanted forest, and he slept in a shrine (or chapel) there, and was awakened at midnight by the noises of cats yelling and dancing. The cats could be heard saying: ""Do not tell Shippeitaro!""
Afterwards, the warrior visited a nearby village, and there he answered a girl's plea for help. It was the village custom to sacrifice a maiden to the mountain spirit, and it was her turn that year. She was placed inside a cage (or cask) and left at the shrine. The warrior made inquiries to find out about the famous dog Schippeitaro (standard modern romanization: Shippeitarō), owned by the prince's overseer, and obtained permission to borrow the dog. The warrior then replaced the maiden inside the cage with Schippeitaro. The cage was brought to the shrine, and the cats arrived. When the huge black cat opened the cage, Shippeitaro jumped out and killed it. The warrior entered the fray and together they killed several more cats, and the rest of them fled. The warrior returned Schippeitaro to his rightful owner, and the village afterwards held an annual festival in honor of the warrior and the heroic dog."
shita_kiri_suzume,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shita-kiri_Suzume,Shita-kiri Suzume,"Shita-kiri Suzume (舌切り雀, shita-kiri suzume), translated literally into ""Tongue-Cut Sparrow"", is a traditional Japanese fable telling of a kind old man, his avaricious wife and an injured sparrow. The story explores the effects of greed, friendship and jealousy on the characters.
Andrew Lang included it as The Sparrow with the Slit Tongue in The Pink Fairy Book.The basic form of the tale is common throughout the world.

","Once upon a time there lived a poor old woodcutter with his wife, who earned their living by cutting wood and fishing. The old man was honest and kind but his wife was arrogant and greedy. One morning, the old man went into the mountains to cut timber and saw an injured sparrow crying out for help. Feeling sorry for the bird, the man took it back to his home and fed it some rice to try to help it recover. His wife, being very greedy and rude, was annoyed that he would waste precious food on such a small and insignificant little thing as a sparrow. The old man, however, continued caring for the bird.
The man had to return to the mountains one day and left the bird in the care of the old woman, who had no intention of feeding it. After her husband left, she went out fishing. While she was gone, the sparrow got into some starch that was left out and eventually ate all of it. The old woman was so angry upon her return that she cut out the bird's tongue and sent it flying back into the mountains from where it came.
The old man went searching for the bird and, with the help of other sparrows, found his way into a bamboo grove in which the sparrow's inn was located. A multitude of sparrows greeted him and led him to his friend, the little sparrow he saved. The others brought him food and sang and danced for him.
Upon his departure, they presented him with a choice of a large basket or a small basket as a present. Being an older man, he chose the small basket as he supposed it would be the least heavy. When he arrived home, he opened the basket and discovered a large amount of treasure inside. The wife, learning of the existence of a larger basket, ran to the sparrow's inn in the hope of getting more treasure for herself. She chose the larger basket but was warned not to open it before getting home.
Such was her greed that the wife could not resist opening the basket before she returned to the house. To her surprise, the box was full of deadly snakes and other monsters. They startled her so much that she tumbled all the way down the mountain, presumably to her death."

","A poor couple had many children, and one day had two more sons.  Both boys looked about the cottage and set off to seek their fortune so quickly that the second son had to catch up to the first.  When they met, they baptized each other by their chosen names, Shortshanks and King Sturdy, and set out in different directions.  King Sturdy said that Shortshanks could summon him by calling his name three times, but should do so only in the last extremity.
Shortshanks came across, in turn, three old women each of whom had only one eye; he stole each eye, and the women bought them back in return for an enchanted sword, an enchanted ship that could fly over land, and the art of brewing one hundred lasts of malt at once.  He used the ship to sail to the king's castle, where he got a job working for the kitchen-maid.  The castle was hung with black, and he learned that the princess had been promised to three ogres, one of whom was coming to fetch her.  Ritter Red had promised to try to save her, but they do not know that he can do it.
The next day, the princess went down to the sea strand.  Ritter Red went with her but, as soon as everyone else was gone, climbed a tree for safety.  Shortshanks asked permission to go down to the sea and, having got it, fought the five-headed ogre that came.  The princess had him sleep a time in her lap, and threw over him a tinsel robe.  Ritter Red threatened to kill the princess if she told who had killed the ogre and cut out its tongue and liver.  Shortshanks took the gold and silver from the ogre's ship and gave it to the kitchen-maid.  He then fought the ten-headed ogre, and the princess threw a silver robe over him while he slept, after.  The third day, he fought the fifteen-headed ogre, and the princess threw over him a golden robe, but before he slept, she told him what Ritter Red had done and would do, and he told her to demand him as the cup-bearer for the wedding; he would spill some of Ritter Red's wine but none of hers, and Ritter Red would strike him three times, but on the third, she was to proclaim that he was the true killer of the ogres.
Each time Ritter Red struck him, it revealed a new robe, and when the princess proclaimed the truth, Ritter Red produced the lungs and tongues, and Shortshanks the silver and gold, and the king judged that Shortshanks was the true killer and threw Ritter Red in a snake pit.
The king told Shortshanks that another ogre had carried off his older daughter.  Shortshanks asked for a long iron cable, five hundred men, and food for them all, and had it put on his ship.  The ship carried them to the middle of the sea.  Shortshanks tied the cable to himself and descended, with orders to be pulled back up if he pulled the cable.  At the bottom, he found the princess, who told him that the ogre was looking for someone who could brew one hundred lasts of malt at once, for his feast.  The princess told the ogre of him, and the ogre set him to brew.  He brewed the ale so strong that all the ogres died of it.  Then he had the five hundred men pull up him, the princess, and the ogre's gold and silver.
Both princesses wanted to marry him, but he wanted to marry the first one he saved, the younger.  He summoned his brother King Sturdy, who saw there was no danger, and struck him down.  Shortshanks  told him why he wanted him, and King Sturdy begged his forgiveness.  Shortshanks sent him into the house, saying that whichever princess kissed him would marry him, because the older was stronger and bigger and would reach him first.  So King Sturdy married the older, and Shortshanks the younger, princess."

It was first published in Uralsky Sovremennik in 1938, and later included in The Malachite Casket collection. In this fairy tale, the characters meet the legendary zoomorphic creature from the Ural folklore called Silver Hoof.

He preferred not to call himself ""translator"", he believed that ""communicator"" was more appropriate.

Daryonka begs the old man to take her hunting, and he reluctantly agrees. The cat follows them too. In the forest, Kokovanya goes hunting every day and comes back with a lot of regular goat meat and skins. Soon they have so much meat that Kokovanya has to go back to the village to bring the horse, so that they could carry everything back. He leaves the girl in the forest for a while.
Next morning Daryonka sees Silver Hoof passing by. That night, she sees her cat Muryonka sitting in the glade with the goat in front of her, as if they are communicating. They run about the glade for a long time. Next day Muryonka and the goat are gone, but Kokovanya and Daryonka find a lot of gemstones.

","A father has three sons, the youngest named Ivan the Fool, for he usually stays on the stove most of the time. On his deathbed, the man asks his sons to hold a vigil on his grave for three nights, each son on each night.
The man dies and is buried. When the time comes, the elder brother sends Ivan in his stead. Ivan goes to his father's grave on the first night. The grave opens and his father's spirit asks if his elder son is there, but Ivan answers that it is him. The spirit summons a horse named Sivko-Burko, ""Magic Black Steed"", and asks the animal to serve his son just as it has served him.
On the second night, the middle brother sends Ivan in his stead. He meets his father's spirit near the grave and Sivko-Burko appears to him again. On the third night, Ivan the Fool goes himself to his father's grave and is given the horse Sivko-Burko, then his father's spirit finally rests in the grave.
Some time later, the tsar issues a proclamation: whoever jumps high enough on a horse and tear the princess's portrait down ""from high up on the house"" shall have her a wife. Ivan's brothers leave him by the stove at home and go to watch the event. Meanwhile, Ivan the Fool summons Sivko-Burko. The horse comes, venting fire from its nostrils. Ivan the Fool climbs into one of the horse's ears and comes out of the other dresses in knightly garments.
The mysterious knight rides to the tsar's palace and jumps very high to tear down the princess's portrait, but misses by ""three logs"". He rides back to the steppe, turns back to Ivan the Fool, dimisses Sivko-Burko and goes back home to the stove. The brothers return home and comment on the mysterious riders.

sleeping_beauty,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty,Sleeping Beauty,"""Sleeping Beauty"" (French: La Belle au bois dormant), or ""Little Briar Rose"" (German: Dornröschen), also titled in English as ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Woods"", is a classic fairy tale about a princess who is cursed to sleep for a hundred years by an evil fairy, to be awakened by a handsome prince at the end of them. The good fairy, realizing that the princess would be frightened if alone when she awakens, uses her wand to put every living person and animal in the palace asleep, to awaken when the princess does.The earliest known version of the story is found in the narrative Perceforest, composed between 1330 and 1344. The tale was first published by Giambattista Basile in his collection of tales titled The Pentamerone (published posthumously in 1634). Basile's version was later adapted and published by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697. The version that was later collected and printed by the Brothers Grimm was an orally transmitted version of the literary tale published by Perrault.The Aarne-Thompson classification system for folktales classifies ""Sleeping Beauty"" as being a 410 tale type, meaning it includes a princess who is forced into an enchanted sleep and is later awakened reversing the magic placed upon her. The story has been adapted many times throughout history and has continued to be retold by modern storytellers throughout various media.

","The folktale begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item. In Basile's version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of flax. In Perrault's and the Grimm Brothers' versions, the item is a spindle. The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep. After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, Sun, Moon, and Talia, the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger. She is discovered in her castle by a wandering king, who ""carrie[s] her to a bed, where he gather[s] the first fruits of love."" He leaves her there and she later gives birth to twins.According to Maria Tatar, there are versions of the story that include a second part to the narrative that details the couple's troubles after their union; some folklorists believe the two parts were originally separate tales.The second part begins after the prince and princess have had children. Through the course of the tale, the princess and her children are introduced in some way to another woman from the prince's life. This other woman is not fond of the prince's new family, and calls a cook to kill the children and serve them for dinner. Instead of obeying, the cook hides the children and serves livestock. Next, the other woman orders the cook to kill the princess. Before this can happen, the other woman's true nature is revealed to the prince and then she is subjected to the very death that she had planned for the princess. The princess, prince, and their children live happily ever after."

","A king and queen made a vow that, if they had a child, they would make one fountain run with oil and another with wine.  The queen gave birth to a son, and they set up the fountains so that everyone could take oil and wine.  At the end of the seven years, the fountains were running dry, and an ogress came to take the last with a sponge and pitcher.  Once she had labored to collect it all, the prince threw a ball, breaking the pitcher.  She cursed him to be unable to marry until he found Snow-White-Fire-Red.
When he grew up, he remembered this and set out.  One night he slept in a great plain where there was a large house.  In the morning, he saw an ogress come and call to Snow-White-Fire-Red to let down her hair.  When the ogress left, he called to her, and she, thinking it was her mother (as she called the ogress), let down her hair.  He climbed it and told her his tale.  She told him the ogress would eat him, and so she hid him and asked the ogress how she could escape, if she wanted to.  The ogress told her that she would have to enchant all furniture to answer in her own voice, but that ogress would climb and find out in time, and so she would have to take seven balls of yarn and throw them down as the ogress caught up.
Snow-White-Fire-Red enchanted all the furniture, took the yarn, and fled with the prince.  The ogress called to the furniture, and it answered until finally she climbed and discovered that the girl was gone.  She chased after, calling to Snow-White-Fire-Red to turn around, which would have let her enchant her.  Snow-White-Fire-Red threw down the yarn, and each ball impeded and injured her until she cursed the prince to forget Snow-White-Fire-Red as soon as his mother kissed him, and the ogress died.
The lovers went on, and the prince told Snow-White-Fire-Red that he would get her suitable clothing to appear at court.  He forbade his mother to kiss him, but she came into his bedroom at night and kissed him while he slept, and he forgot Snow-White-Fire-Red.
An old woman took pity on Snow-White-Fire-Red and took her home.  Snow-White-Fire-Red made marvelous things, and the old woman sold them.  One day she told the old woman to get her scraps of cloth from the palace, and she dressed two doves that the old woman owned.  The two birds flew to the palace, where everyone admired them, and the doves told the story of how the prince had won Snow-White-Fire-Red.  He remembered and ordered the birds to be followed, and soon he and Snow-White-Fire-Red were married."
snow_white,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White,Snow White,"""Snow White"" is a 19th-century German fairy tale that is today known widely across the Western world. The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection Grimms' Fairy Tales and numbered as Tale 53. The original German title was Sneewittchen, a Low German form, but the first version gave the High German translation Schneeweißchen, and the tale has become known in German by the mixed form Schneewittchen. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.The fairy tale features such elements as the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the characters of the Evil Queen and the Seven Dwarfs. The seven dwarfs were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and then given different names in Walt Disney's 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as ""Snow White"", should not be confused with the story of ""Snow-White and Rose-Red"" (in German ""Schneeweißchen und Rosenrot""), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.
In the Aarne–Thompson folklore classification, tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include ""Bella Venezia"", ""Myrsina"", ""Nourie Hadig"", ""Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree"", ""The Young Slave"", and ""La petite Toute-Belle"".","At the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, ""How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony."" Sometime later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is a very beautiful, but also vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, ""Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen also wants him to return with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan she tearfully begs the huntsman, ""Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!"" After seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of an animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's attempt to kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once again: ""Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?"" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death, and decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints; the dwarfs return just in time to revive Snow White by loosening the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl is overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite and then falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally killed her, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with this miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, except for Snow White's stepmother.
The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White, asks again her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is yet fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White has taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.

stan_bolovan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Bolovan,Stan Bolovan,"Stan Bolovan is a Romanian fairy tale collected in Rumänische Märchen by Mite Kremnitz (1882). Fairy tale collector Andrew Lang included it in his The Violet Fairy Book (1901).  Versions of the tale were later retold by Ruth Manning-Sanders in A Book of Dragons (1965) and A Choice of Magic (1971), and by Christopher Rawson in The Usborne Book of Dragons (1979).

","Stan Bolovan's wife was sad, though they were prosperous.  Finally, she confessed that she was grieved that they had no children.  Stan visited a wise man and begged him for children, and ignored his warnings about feeding them all.  He returned to find his wife delighted:  they had a hundred children.  Soon, they found they could not feed them all, and Stan set out to find food. He found a flock of sheep and hoped to steal some, but a dragon stole animals and milk from the flock.  He asked, and the shepherds promised him a third of the flock if he rid them of the dragon.  He met up with the dragon and said he ate rocks by night and flowers by day and would fight.  He set a contest:  he squeezed buttermilk from cheese, and the dragon tried to squeeze it from a rock, and had to own he was better.  The dragon offered him service with his mother, who would pay him sacks of ducats. The mother set them two trials:  her son threw a staff as far as he could, and then it was Stan's turn.  First, he told the dragon he was afraid that he would kill him with the force; then he claimed to be waiting until the moon got out of the way. The mother then sent them to fetch water, and Stan could not have carried the skins she sent, but when he said it was too much bother and threatened to carry the stream instead, the dragon carried them for him.  The mother then sent them to gather wood, and Stan started to tie trees together, declaring he would carry back the entire wood, and the dragon brought back wood for him, before he uprooted the forest. The mother told her son to crack open his head in the night.  Stan hid under a pig's trough and was not harmed.  They gave him gold to go away, which he could not carry, but he said he wanted to stay in her service, because his friends would be ashamed of him, to carry so little; they urged him to go, and he went on the condition that the dragon carry back the gold for him. He did not want to go all the way home with the dragon, so that it would not know where he lived, but his hungry children came running, and were so hungry they shouted for the dragon's flesh. Terrified, the dragon dropped the gold and ran away, leaving Stan and his family to prosper with it."
starlight__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_(fairy_tale),Starlight (fairy tale),"Starlight or Starlet (French: Étoilette) is a French literary fairy tale by Marie-Madeleine de Lubert. It was included in her revised edition, published in 1753, of Henriette-Julie de Murat's last novel,  Les Lutins du château de Kernosy (The Sprites of Kernosy Castle, 1710), which is why it is often attributed to Madame de Murat.

","A king, whose kingdom was constantly imperiled by another king, had an only son who had fallen in love with a slave, Starlight.  Her family was quite unknown, but he cared nothing for anything but her.  Angry, the queen had the slave imprisoned in a tower. A beautiful white cat kept her company. The prince despaired. His father, because of a new attack, implored him to lead the army. The prince did, and the father promised that no one had harmed Starlight and that he would see her when he returned. He led the army and utterly defeated the other king's, capturing the king himself, but the king reneged on his promise.  The prince freed the captive king, and the king and queen had him imprisoned.  One day, Starlight confided to her cat that she was certain he had forgotten her, and the cat answered that he was also imprisoned. The cat then revealed herself as the fairy Ermine White, and told her that she was a princess. She gave her a box to be opened in her worst need, turned the tower in a stair for her escape, and made her promise to never tell who had freed her. She found the prince, and they concluded that she had to hide, which would cause his parents to free him, and send him a message of her refuge. The white cat warned them that the king's men were coming, and Starlight fled.  
She found her way to the forest, where centaurs found her; this was where they had taken refuge after the unpleasantness with the Lapiths at the wedding of Pirithous.  They let her stay with them, and one bore her message to the court, that the prince could hunt a white doe with silver hooves in their forest.  They met there, and went to the sea, where they found a marvelous ship awaiting them, with white cats as the sailors.  They set sail, but Starlight confided in the prince how she had been rescued, and a storm overtook them.  The waves separated them, carrying them to different countries. The prince was carried to a quiet country, where the women did the fighting, with crabapples.  He found the king abed, resting, while his wife fought the war; he thrashed him and made him go to war himself; once there, he routed the enemies.  But the kingdom was attacked and defeated, and the prince taken prisoner, whereupon he was put in a boat and lost consciousness.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself in a ship that sailed by itself, back to his parents' kingdom, where he learned they had died of grief, and he was now king.  He made peace with the centaurs but was always sad.  His subjects proposed that he marry; he told them that he wished to marry only Starlight, but even a reward brought no news of her.
Starlight had washed ashore and been found by a king who sheltered her.  One day, his queen asked her for her story, and telling it, she revealed she was their long-lost daughter.  Her father resolved to marry her to a neighboring king.  She opened the box and was surrounded by a cloud that darkened her skin and made her ugly.  The fairy Ermine-White carried her off, back to her prince, and in his court, she became herself again.  They married."

Unbeknowst to them, the prince, that night, was spying on them. The next morning, the prince calls them to court and orders them to repeat their wishes. The prince marries the youngest sister and, eight months later, has to go to war. While he is away, the queen mother replaces her three grandchildren for a puppy, a kitten and a little mouse, and orders the nurse to cast them in a box in the sea.
Out of pity, the nurse hides the three children amidst the reeds and leaves. A passing shepherd grazes nearby with his goats and a she-goat returns with an empty udder. The shepherd notices the three babies and takes them home to raise them. He also builds a tower as their house.
Years pass, and the prince, while riding through the kingdom, sights the three children in the distance. He returns home to tell the queen mother that the three children were nearly identical to the one his former wife promised. Noticing that the children are alive, she sends the nurse to get rid of them.
The nurse visits the three siblings and compliments their house, but it is lacking something: a branch that makes music, a magic mirror that can peer into the whole world, its princes and kingdoms, and the bird Dikjeretto, which knows the languages of men and can describe the visions that appear in the mirror.
The older brothers journey and meet an old hermit on the way, who directs them to a place where two dragons guard the branch, and the place where 40 dragons guard the mirror. They bring the objects home. However, on the third quest, the brothers try to catch the bird, but the animal transforms both in stone.
The girl, seeing her brothers's life tokens turning black, decides to get the bird herself. She meets the hermit, who instructs her on how to capture the bird. She catches the bird and asks it how she can save her brothers. The bird answers she can find a magical healing water where two mountains clash against each other. She gets the water and sprinkles it on her brothers. The three siblings return home with the bird and their adoptive father celebrates with a grand banquet.
The prince takes notice of the grand festivities and decides to invite the three siblings to the palace. The bird insists it be brought with them, since the prince is their father, and to prepare a dish with diamonds inside and serve it to the prince. They obey the bird's instructions and serve the dish with the diamonds. The prince complains that it is impossible to eat such a dish, and the bird retorts that so is a human woman to give birth to animals. The prince notices his mother's deception, restores his wife from the chicken coop and banishes his mother."

Ardan, the eldest son, declared he would set out in search of his sister.  His mother reproved him for not asking his father first. But since he had made a vow, she made two cakes, a large one and a little one, and asked which one he wanted, the big one without her blessing or the little one with it.  He picked the large cake.  When a raven asked him for some, he refused it.  Then he came to an old man in a cottage, with a young woman combing her hair of gold.  The old man offered to let him watch his three cows for a year.  The young woman warned against it, but he refused her advice rudely and took the service anyway.
The old man told him to follow the cows, because they knew good pasture, and to never leave them. But the first day watching the cows, he saw a golden cock and a silver hen, and let them distract him, and also a staff of gold and a staff of silver.  When he brought them back, the cows had no milk, only water.  The old man turned Ardan to stone.
Then Ruais, the second son, set out in the same manner, and suffered the same fate.
Finally, Covan the Brown-haired, the youngest, asked leave to go after his brothers.  His father gave him his blessing, and Covan took the smaller cake and gave the raven some.  When he came to the cottage, he thanked the maiden for her advice, though he did not take it.  He followed the cows and sat down when they came to pasture.  There he heard music and listened to it.  A boy ran to him and claimed his cows were in the corn; Covan said he could have driven them out in the time it took to come to him.  Then the boy returned with the claim that dogs were worrying the cows; Covan said he could not have driven the dogs out in the time it took to reach him.
Then the cows went on.  They went through a barren pasture, on which a mare and her foal were fat; a lush pasture with a starving mare and her foal, and a lake with two boats, one with happy youths going to the land of the Sun, and the other with grim shapes, going to the land of Night.  The cows went on, and it grew so dark he could not see the cows.  The Dog of Maol-mor, whom he had heard of, bade him stay the night.  He did.  In the morning, the dog was grateful, because he took what was offered and did not mock him, and so said he could call on him for aid.  The next day, the cows ended in a barren plain.  The raven offered him hospitality and he took it.  The raven was grateful that he took it and did not mock it, and so said he could call on him for aid.  The next day, the cows ended by a river.  The famous otter Doran-donn offered Covan his hospitality, and he took it, and the otter offered to come to his aid.
Then the cows returned, and they had milk instead of water.  The old man was pleased and wanted to know what Covan wanted as a reward.  Covan wanted to know how to get his brothers and sister back.  The old man warned him that it would be hard, but told him where to get a roe with white feet and a deer's antlers, a duck with a green body and a gold neck, and a salmon with silver skin and red gills.  If he brought those to the old man, he could get his brothers and sister back.  The dog helped him catch the roe; the raven, the duck; and the otter, the salmon.  The old man gave him back his sister, and restored his brothers, though they would be fated to wander forever for their idle and unfaithful ways.
Covan asked him his name.  He said he was the Spirit of Age."

The tale was published in the Siddi-Kur (or Siddhi-Kur), a compilation of Kalmyk and Mongolian stories.

","In the tale How the Schimnu-Khan was Slain, of Tibetan or Mongolian provenance, the first part shows the birth of a youth named Massang ""of the bull's head"". A poor man's only cow gives birth to a half-man, half-cow hybrid and its owner is horrified by the creature. The cow-man, receiving clemency, flees from the old man and into the world. The youth meets a ""black-coloured man (...) born of the dark woods"", a ""green-coloured man (...) born of the green meadows"" and a ""white-coloured man (...) born of the crystal rock"" and the quartet soon move to a dweliing overlooking a hill. They take turns cooking the food while the others gather game nearby. One day, a small old woman appears and beats the three companions to steal their food (""milk and meat"", as the story says). On the fourth day, Massang sees the little old woman and matches strength with the creature. After three tests, the little woman escapes and leaves behind a blood trail for the four heroes to follow. They soon come to an opening in the rock; down below, the witch's corpse strewn about near heaps and heaps of treasure. Massang descends to take the treasure to his companions but they betray him and leave him for dead in the pit. Massang sleeps on the witch's corpse - for years - and when he awakes, three cherry trees have sprouted, which he uses to climb to the surface. He visits his treacherous companions and discovers they have made a life for themselves with the witch's treasure, but they beg Massang to spare them.

In the second part of the tale, Massang decides to spare his former companions and carries on with his life. He finds a beautiful maiden carrying water in a jug and follows her. Massang arrives at the court of Churmusta Tengri, who bids welcome to the hero and tells him his arrival is most propitious. Churmusta Tengri explains that there will be a war between a white host of Tengri forces and the black host of the Schummu. Massang helps the white hosts by defeating the black host leader. At the end of the tale, a Schummu strikes a hammer against the ground and sparks fly out, originating seven stars of a constellation (Ursa Major or the Pleiades).[6] In this version of the tale, translated by British folklorist Rachel Harriette Busk, the narrator, in the framing device of the book, comments that he never returned to his master to bring him riches."
the_adventures_of_pinocchio,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio,The Adventures of Pinocchio,"The Adventures of Pinocchio ( pin-OH-kee-oh; Italian: Le avventure di Pinocchio [le avvenˈtuːre di piˈnɔkkjo]; commonly shortened to Pinocchio) is a novel for children by an Italian author Carlo Collodi, written in Pescia. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father, a poor woodcarver named Geppetto.
It was originally published in a serial form as The Story of a Puppet (Italian: La storia di un burattino) in the Giornale per i bambini, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15, but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882. In February 1883, the story was published in a single book. Since then, the spread of Pinocchio on the main markets for children's books of the time has been continuous and uninterrupted, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide.A universal icon and a metaphor of the human condition, the book is considered a canonical piece of children's literature and has had great impact on world culture. Philosopher Benedetto Croce reputed it as one of the greatest works of Italian literature. Since its first publication, it has inspired hundreds of new editions, stage plays, merchandising, television series and movies, such as Walt Disney's iconic animated version, and commonplace ideas such as a liar's long nose.
According to extensive research by the Fondazione Nazionale Carlo Collodi and UNESCO sources in the late 1990s, the book has been translated into as many as 260 languages worldwide, making it one of the world's most translated books. Likely one of the best-selling books ever published, the actual total sales since first being published are unknown due to the many reductions and different versions. The story has been a public domain work in the U.S. since 1940. According to Viero Peroncini: ""some sources report 35 million [copies sold], others 80, but it is only a way, even a rather idle one, of quantifying an unquantifiable success"". According to Francelia Butler, it also remains ""the most translated Italian book and, after the Bible, the most widely read"".","The story begins in Tuscany, Italy. A carpenter named Master Antonio, but whom everyone calls Master Cherry, has found a block of wood that he plans to carve into a leg for his table. When he begins, however, the log shouts out. Frightened by the talking log, Master Cherry gives it to his neighbor Geppetto, an extremely poor man who plans to make a living as a puppeteer in hopes of earning ""a crust of bread and a glass of wine"".

Geppetto carves the block into a boy and names him ""Pinocchio"". As soon as Pinocchio's nose has been carved, it begins to grow with his congenital impudence. Before he is even built, Pinocchio already has a mischievous attitude; no sooner than Geppetto is finished carving Pinocchio's feet, the puppet proceeds to kick him. Once the puppet has been finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the door and away into the town. He is caught by a Carabiniere, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and imprisons Geppetto.
Left alone, Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat. Once he arrives at home, a talking cricket who has lived in the house for over a century warns him of the perils of disobedience and hedonism. In retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket, more accurately than he intended to, and accidentally kills it. 

Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg, but what comes out of it is a little bird that flies out the window forcing Pinocchio to leave the house to ask for food. Then he knocks on an old man's door to ask for food. The man thinks that Pinocchio was one of the hooligans who ring the bells for fun, and instead of giving him a good piece of bread all he gets is a bucket of cold water on his head. Cold and wet, Pinocchio comes home and lies down on a stove, but the next day when he wakes up he falls to the ground with burned feet. Luckily, Geppetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet. In gratitude, he promises to attend school, and Geppetto sells his only coat to buy him a school book.

On his way to school the next morning, Pinocchio encounters the Great Marionette Theatre, and he sells his school book in order to buy a ticket for the show. During the performance, the puppets Harlequin, Pulcinella and Signora Rosaura on stage recognize him in the audience and call out to him, angering the puppet master Mangiafuoco. Upset, he breaks up the excitement and decides to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his lamb dinner. After Pinocchio pleads to be saved, Mangiafuoco gives in and decides to burn Harlequin. After Pinocchio pleads for Harlequin's salvation, Mangiafuoco gives up. When he learns about Pinocchio's poor father, he ultimately releases him and gives him five gold pieces to give to Geppetto.

As Pinocchio travels home to give the coins to his father, he meets a fox and a cat. The Cat pretends to be blind, and the Fox pretends to be lame. A white blackbird tries to warn Pinocchio of their lies, but the blackbird is eaten by the Cat. The two animals convince Pinocchio that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles outside the city of Catchfools in the Land of Barn Owls, they will grow into a tree with gold coins.
They stop at the Red Lobster Inn, where the Fox and the Cat gorge themselves on food at Pinocchio's expense and ask to be awoken by midnight. Two hours before the set time, the pair abandon Pinocchio, leaving him to pay for the meal with one of his coins. They instruct the innkeeper to tell Pinocchio that they left after receiving a message stating that the Cat's eldest kitten had fallen ill and that they would meet Pinocchio at the Field of Miracles in the morning.

As Pinocchio sets off for Catchfools, the ghost of the Talking Cricket appears, telling him to go home and give the coins to his father. Pinocchio ignores his warnings again. As he passes through a forest, the Fox and Cat, disguised as bandits, ambush Pinocchio, robbing him. The puppet hides the coins in his mouth and escapes to a white house after biting off the Cat's paw. Upon knocking on the door, Pinocchio is greeted by a young fairy with turquoise hair who says she is dead and waiting for a hearse. Unfortunately, the bandits catch Pinocchio and hang him in a tree. After a while, the Fox and Cat get tired of waiting for the puppet to suffocate, and they leave.

The Fairy has Pinocchio rescued by summoning a falcon to get him down and having her poodle servant Medoro pick him up in her stagecoach. The Fairy calls in three famous doctors to tell her whether Pinocchio is dead or not. Two of them, an owl and a crow, are unsure of Pinocchio's status with the owl claiming that Pinocchio is alive and the crow claiming that Pinocchio is dead. The third doctor is the Ghost of the Talking Cricket who says that the puppet is fine, but has been disobedient and hurt his father. The Fairy administers medicine to Pinocchio who consents to take it after four undertaker rabbits arrive to carry away his body. Recovered, Pinocchio lies to the Fairy when she asks what has happened to the gold coins, and his nose grows until it is so long that he cannot turn around in the room. The Fairy explains that Pinocchio's lies are making his nose grow and calls in a flock of woodpeckers to chisel it down to size. The Fairy sends for Geppetto to come and live with them in the forest cottage.

When Pinocchio heads out to meet his father, he once again encounters the Fox and the Cat. When Pinocchio notices the Cat's missing paw, the Fox claims that they had to sacrifice it to feed a hungry old wolf. They remind the puppet of the Field of Miracles, and finally, he agrees to go with them and plant his gold. They finally reach the city of Catchfools, where every animal in town has done something exceedingly foolish and now suffers as a result. Upon reaching the Field of Miracles, Pinocchio buries his coins and then leaves for the twenty minutes that it will take for his gold to grow into gold coin trees. After Pinocchio leaves, the Fox and the Cat dig up the coins and run away.

Once Pinocchio returns, he learns of the Fox and the Cat's treachery from a parrot who mocks Pinocchio for falling for their tricks. Pinocchio rushes to the Catchfools courthouse where he reports the theft of the coins to a gorilla judge. Although he is moved by Pinocchio's plea, the gorilla judge sentences Pinocchio to four months in prison for the crime of foolishness as he is taken away by two mastiffs dressed as Gendarmerie. Fortunately, all criminals are released early by the jailers when the unseen young Emperor of Catchfools declares a celebration following his army's victory over the town's enemies. Upon being released by stating to the jailer that he committed a crime, Pinocchio leaves Catchfools.

As Pinocchio heads back to the forest, he finds an enormous snake with a smoking tail blocking the way. After some confusion, he asks the serpent to move, but the serpent remains completely still. Concluding that it is dead, Pinocchio begins to step over it, but the serpent suddenly rises up and hisses at the marionette, toppling him over onto his head. Struck by Pinocchio's fright and comical position, the snake laughs so hard he bursts an artery and dies.
Pinocchio then heads back to the Fairy's house in the forest, but he sneaks into a farmer's yard to steal some grapes. He is caught in a weasel trap where he encounters a glowworm. The farmer finds Pinocchio and ties him up in the doghouse of his late watch dog Melampo to guard the chicken coop. When Pinocchio foils the chicken-stealing weasels, the farmer frees the puppet as a reward. Pinocchio finally comes to where the cottage was, finds nothing but a gravestone, and believes that the Fairy has died of sorrow.

A friendly pigeon sees Pinocchio mourning the Fairy's death and offers to give him a ride to the seashore, where Geppetto is building a boat in which to search for Pinocchio (depending on the version of the story he sails in search for Pinocchio on near islands or following Mangiafuoco and his puppet theatre headed to the Nuovo Mondo). Pinocchio is washed ashore when he tries to swim to his father. Geppetto is then swallowed by The Terrible Dogfish. Pinocchio accepts a ride from a dolphin to the nearest island called the Island of Busy Bees.

Upon arriving on the Island of Busy Bees, Pinocchio can only get food in return for labor. Pinocchio offers to carry a lady's jug home in return for food and water. When they get to the lady's house, Pinocchio recognizes the lady as the Fairy, now miraculously old enough to be his mother. She says she will act as his mother, and Pinocchio will begin going to school. She hints that if Pinocchio does well in school and tries his hardest to be good for one whole year, then he will become a real boy.
Pinocchio studies hard and rises to the top of his class, but this makes the other schoolboys jealous. The other boys trick Pinocchio into playing hookey by saying they saw a large sea monster at the beach, the same one that swallowed Geppetto. However, the boys were lying and a fight breaks out. One boy named Eugene is hit by Pinocchio's school book, though Pinocchio did not throw it. Pinocchio is accused of injuring Eugene by two Carabinieres, but the puppet escapes. During his escape, Pinocchio saves a drowning Mastiff named Alidoro. In exchange, Alidoro later saves Pinocchio from The Green Fisherman, who was going to eat the marionette as Pinocchio returns home. After meeting the Snail that works for the Fairy, Pinocchio is given another chance by the Fairy.

Pinocchio does excellently in school and passes with high honors. The Fairy promises that Pinocchio will be a real boy the next day and says he should invite all his friends to a party. He goes to invite everyone, but he is sidetracked when he meets his closest friend from school, a boy nicknamed Candlewick, who is about to go to a place called Toyland where everyone plays all day and never works. Pinocchio goes along with him when they are taken there by The Coachman, and they have a wonderful time for the next five months.

One morning in the fifth month, Pinocchio and Candlewick awake with donkeys' ears. A Dormouse tells Pinocchio that he has got a donkey fever: boys who do nothing but play and never study always turn into donkeys. Soon, both Pinocchio and Candlewick are fully transformed. Pinocchio is sold to a circus by The Coachman. He is trained by the ringmaster to do tricks until he falls and sprains his leg. The ringmaster then sells Pinocchio to a man who wants to skin him and make a drum. The man throws the donkey into the sea to drown him. But when the man goes to retrieve the corpse, all he finds is a living marionette. Pinocchio explains that the fish ate all the donkey skin off him and he is now a puppet again.

Pinocchio dives back into the water and swims out to sea. When the Terrible Dogfish appears, Pinocchio swims from it at the advice of the Fairy in the form of a little blue-furred goat from atop a high rock, but is swallowed by it. Inside the Dogfish, Pinocchio unexpectedly finds Geppetto, who has been living on a ship inside there. Pinocchio and Geppetto with the help of a tuna, a companion inside the Dogfish, who, following his example, managed to escape and took them on his back to the mainland. Pinocchio gives a kiss of thanks and leaves with his father in search of a place to stay.

Pinocchio and Geppetto encounter the Fox and the Cat who are now impoverished. The Cat has really become blind, and the Fox has really become lame and is also thin, almost hairless, and has chopped off his tail to sell for food. The Fox and the Cat plead for food or money, but Pinocchio rebuffs them and tells them that their misfortunes have served them right for their wickedness. Geppetto and Pinocchio arrive at a small house, which is home to the Talking Cricket. The Talking Cricket says they can stay and reveals that he got his house from a little goat with turquoise hair. Pinocchio gets a job doing work for Farmer Giangio and recognizes the farmer's dying donkey as his friend Candlewick.

After long months of working for the farmer and supporting the ailing Geppetto, Pinocchio goes to town with the forty pennies he has saved to buy himself a new suit. He discovers that the Fairy is ill and needs money. Pinocchio instantly gives the Snail he met back on the Island of Busy Bees all the money he has.
That night, he dreams that he is visited by the Fairy, who kisses him. When he wakes up, he is a real boy at last. His former puppet body lies lifeless on a chair. Furthermore, Pinocchio finds that the Fairy has left him a new suit, boots, and a bag in which he thinks are the forty pennies that he originally gave to her. Instead, the boy is shocked to find forty freshly-minted gold coins. Geppetto also returns to health."

","An orphaned brother and sister moved to another place where the brother opened a shop and married.  One day, he told his sister to keep the house.  The wife was offended, broke all the furniture, and blamed the sister.  The brother said they could buy more.  The wife killed his favorite horse and blamed the sister.  The brother said the dogs could eat it.  Finally, the wife gave birth, cut off the baby's head, and blamed the sister.  The brother took his sister and drove the carriage into a bramble.  He told his sister to disentangle.  When she started, he cut off both her arms at the elbow and drove off.
His sister wept but found her way through the forest to a merchant town.  There a merchant's only son fell madly in love with her and married her.  After two years, he went on a journey, but told his parents to send him word as soon as his child was born.  His wife gave birth to a boy whose arms were gold to his elbows, with stars on his sides, the moon on his forehead, and the sun near his heart.  His grandparents wrote to their son, but the wicked sister-in-law had heard and invited the messenger to her house.  There, she tore the letter to pieces and replaced it with one saying his wife had given birth to a baby half wolf and half bear.  This grieved the merchant's son, but he wrote back that the baby was not to be molested until he returned.  The sister-in-law invited the messenger in again, and substituted a letter saying that his wife should be driven out at once.  His parents tied the baby to her breast and sent her away.
She went away and tried to drink from a well.  Her baby fell into the water.  She wept and tried to think how she could get the baby out.  An old man told her to reach for the baby, despite having no arms; she did so, and her arms were restored and she reached her baby.  She thanked God and went on, coming to a house where her brother and husband were staying.  Her sister-in-law tried to keep her out as a beggar woman, but her husband said she could tell stories.  She told her own, and they unwrapped the baby and saw she had told the truth.  Her brother tied his wife to the tail of a mare; it returned with only her braid, the rest strewn over the field.  They harnessed the horses and went back to the husband's mother and father."

","A king's son set out to see a battle, where every animal fought; he promised to bring back to his father the news of who would be the king of the animals that year.  He arrived when the fight was almost over, but a snake and a raven still fought.  He cut off the head of the snake.  The raven, in gratitude, flew him to a castle where his sister lived, and the prince spent the night there.  The raven then flew to another castle, where he also spent the night, but the next morning he met a handsome youth, who had been the enchanted raven.  The youth gave him a bundle and warned him not to open it until he was in the place where he most wanted to be.
When he was nearing his father's house, he opened the bundle.  A great castle sprang up, and an irate giant demanded to know why he had put it there.  It offered to put it back if the prince gave him his first son, when he reached seven years of age.  Then the prince went out, and opened the bundle near his father's lands.  He went into the castle, and found a pretty maid who was willing to be his wife.  They had a son, and seven years later, they tried to put off the giant with the cook's son, and the butcher's son, but finally had to yield their own.
The giant raised him.  One day, he heard music and found the giant's daughter.  She told him the next day the giant would ask him to marry one of her two older sisters, but she wanted him to insist on her, because she did not like the bridegroom he wanted for her.
The prince asked, but the annoyed giant demanded that he clean out the byre, or he would not get his youngest but be killed.  He started to clean.  The daughter came by at noon, and the prince fell asleep, but the byre was clean when he woke.  The giant knew he did not clean it, but set him to thatch it with birds' down.  The prince tried to hunt the birds.  At noon, the daughter put him to sleep again, and the roofs were thatched with feathers when he woke.  The giant knew he had not done it, and set him to fetch down a bird's nest.  He tried to climb it and got no more than half way.  The daughter built him a ladder of her fingers, and when he got it down, she left her little finger in the tree.
She told him that the giant would ask him to pick her out from her sisters, and the only mark would be that she was missing her finger.  The wedding was held and celebrated, and the prince picked out his bride from her sisters.  The giant told them to go to rest.  The daughter told her husband that they had to flee at once, and they took a gray filly.  She left behind slices of apples that answered the giant.  Only when the last one had spoken did he realize that they had fled.  He gave chase.  When the giant nearly caught them, the daughter had the prince take a twig from the filly's ear and throw it behind them:  it became a forest.  The giant got through it, and they threw a pebble that became a mountain.  The giant got through it, and they threw a flask of water that became a wave and drowned him.
The daughter forbade him to let anyone or thing in his father's house kiss him, or he would forget her, but a greyhound leaped up to kiss him, and he forgot the daughter.  She stayed in a tree by a well.  A shoemaker's wife and daughter, going to fetch water, both thought her shadow was theirs, and thought themselves too beautiful to fetch water.  The shoemaker went himself, saw her, and persuaded her to come down.
When she stayed his house, some young men tried to woo her, but she made them stick to the latch so they could not approach her.  The shoemaker was making shoes for the king's son, who was to marry, and the daughter persuaded him to take her.  She conjured up a silver and a gold pigeon, and grains.  The silver pigeon ate them, and the golden pigeon taxed him with what the giant's daughter had done for the prince.  At that the prince knew her, and married her a second time."

While the prince rested under it, he heard a verse being pronounced, calling a maiden out, and a beautiful maiden came out.  He seduced her, promising to marry her, and sneaked away the next morning.  He came to a castle, where the master claimed that his own daughter was Sanda-Lucsandra and a wedding was arranged.
The maiden could no longer get back into the bay tree, and so set out in search of the prince.  She traded her clothing, unsuitable for travel, with a monk.  Then she found the carriage where the prince was bringing his bride back.  The prince took her up and she told the story of seeing a maiden weeping in the meadow because a prince had seduced her, and she could no longer get into the bay tree.  He had her tell it to him again and again.
At his parents' castle, on the wedding day, the monk vanished.  The prince went to the room and found the monk hanging by the neck.

","A man dwells in a forest near a rich green meadow. In summer mornings, the grass somehow is treaded all over. He orders his three sons to stand guard near the meadow. The elder two fail on their vigils, beucase they fall asleep through the whole night. When it is the youngest's turn, near ""the hour of the matins"", he sees three doves coming to the meadows, take off their plumages and become human maidens. 
As the girls dance around meadow, the youth takes notice of one of them and intends to have her for himself. He also seizes the opportunity to hide their plumages. As the sun rises, the maidens prepare to depart in bird form, but cannot find their featherskins. They search for them, and sees the youth standing there. They beg him to return their feathers. The youth agrees to their pleading, but first he wants some explanations: one of the girls says they are a princess and two court attendants that live in a palace east of the sun and north of the earth. The youth also asks the princess to become his bride, and to set a date to their marriage. The princess agrees and they promise to remain faithful until their wedding, then departs with her court attendants.
The youth goes home to his father and tells nothing of his nightly adventure. Time passes, and the wedding date approaches. The youth asks his father to prepare a weadding feast for him and invite all of their relatives. By midnight, a luxurious carriage comes to the feast, bringing the princess and her court attendants. The youth introduces her as his intended bride and explains the night adventure at the meadow.
Happiness abound between the couple, but it is short-lived: just before sunrise, the princess tells her bridegroom she must depart, since a Troll killed her father, the true king of the palace east of the sun and north of the earth, and she can only enjoy some hours of freedom around midnight, having to go back before sunrise. The youth understands the urgency of the situation. The princess gives him her golden ring, her court attendants a golden ball, and rushes to leave her wedding feast.
After some days, the youth decides to go after her, and says goodbye to his father. He begins his long quest, searching meadows, valleys and kingdoms for his wife's palace. One day, he finds two giants fighting over their father's inheritance: a pair of magical boots that allow its wearer to take a hundred miles with every step. The youth convinces the giants to part with the boots to settle their little dispute.
The youth reaches another forest, where he finds another pair of giants fighting over a cloak of invisibility. The youth also convices them to give him the cloak to settle their quarrel. Lastly, he finds yet another duo of giants fighting over a sword that kills on its point and revives with its hilt. He also wins the sword.
On the next stop of his journey, he traverses a vast desert, and sees a light in the distance, coming from a little cot. A ""very very old old"" woman takes him in and gives him shelter for the night. The next morning, the old woman summons all ""beasts of the field"" to consult with them if anyone knows the location of the palace. None know it, and the youth departs.
He arrives at another vast desert, with a little cot in the distance that belongs to an ever older woman, ruler of the fishes in the sea. He stays the night and the next morning the old woman summons all fishes. None know where the palace east of the sun and north of the earth is. The old woman bids him consult with her eldest sister, who rules the fowls in the air.
Lastly, the youth reaches a third vast desert, with a small cot on a mountain. The youth greets the eldest sister and explains the motive of his journey.

","A fisherman found two beautiful children in a crystal cradle, a girl and a boy, floating in the river and brought them to his wife to raise as their own. As the babies grew up, their older brothers were cruel to them and the boy and the girl often ran away to the riverbank, where they would feed breadcrumbs to the birds.  In gratitude, the birds taught them to speak their language.
One day the oldest boy taunted them with having no parents, and so the boy and girl went out into the world to seek their fortunes. When they stopped to rest along their journey, they heard birds gossiping, and one bird said that the king had married the youngest daughter of a tailor, over the opposition of the nobles. He was obliged to go to war, and when he returned, he was told that his wife had given birth to twins who had died. Missing her babies, the queen went mad, and had to be shut up in a tower in the mountains where the fresh air might restore her. In fact, the babies had not really died, but were taken to a gardener's cottage, and that night the chamberlain threw them into the river in a crystal cradle, which the children recognized from the story of how the fisherman had found them.
The bird went on to say that only the Bird of Truth could convince the king that the children were really his children, and the bird was kept by a giant who only slept a quarter-hour a day in the castle of Come-and-never-go. Only a witch could tell the way to the castle, and she would not do it unless she was given the water from the fountain of many colours. Furthermore, the Bird of Truth is surrounded by the Birds of ill Faith, and only an owl could tell which one was which.
They went to the city, where they begged hospitality for a night, and were so helpful that the innkeeper asked them to stay. The girl did, but her brother left on his quest. A dove directed him to go with the wind, and by following it, he reached the witch's tower and asked the way to the castle of Come-and-never-go. The witch tried to get him to stay the night, but when he refused, demanded a jug of the many-colored waters, or she would turn him into a lizard. She then directed a dog to lead him to the water.
At the castle, he heard the owl's cry and asked its advice.  It told him to fill the jug from another fountain and then find the white bird in the corner, not the brightly colored birds. He had a quarter of an hour to do the task, and succeeded.  When he brought back the water, the witch threw it over him and told him to become a parrot, but he became more handsome, and all the creatures about the hut threw themselves into the water and became human again. The witch fled.
The courtiers who were responsible for abandoning the children tried to prevent the King from learning about the children, but they talked so much of it that he overheard the commotion and became curious. When the bird flew to him, he listened. The King at once went to embrace his children, and then all three of them freed his wife, their mother, from the tower. The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off, and the couple who had raised them were given riches and honor."

the_black_colt,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Colt_(Iranian_folktale),The Black Colt,"Black Colt (Persian: Korre-ye-Siyah) is an Iranian folktale published by author Forough Hekmat in 1974. It is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 314, ""Goldener"".
Although it differs from variants wherein a hero acquires golden hair, its starting sequence (persecution by the hero's stepmother) is considered by scholarship as an alternate opening to the same tale type.

","In a land to the East of Persia, a king rules with his beautiful wife. She bears him a son they name Malik Khorsheed (""The Sun Prince""). His destiny is foretold to be an unhappy one. He grows up to be a fine horseman and great archer.
One day, his mother dies, and the boy falls into a deep sadness. To appease the boy's grief, the king's viziers tells the king a dervish has come to the palace to bring a gift to the prince: a black colt with a star on its head. The prince takes the horse - which he named Korreh-ę-Siyah (""Black Colt"") - as his friend and companion, and spends the days riding the horse after his studies.
Years pass, and the king marries another queen. The queen begins to despise her step-son, because her husband spends most of his time with the boy, and begins to plot against him. Black Colt senses that the new queen is secretly harbouring ill-will towards the boy, and warns him to be on his guard for any attempt on his life. Malik Khorsheed dismisses the colt's warnings, but heeds the words.
And so the queen begins her plans: she orders some servants to dig up a hole on the way to the stables and fill it with branches. Malik Khorsheed escapes the first attempt by taking another path to the stables, and because the colt warned him. The next time, the queen brings some poisoned food to his room, but the colt warned him not to eat any food she gives him.
The queen, then, plots to destroy the only thing the boy loves more than his father, the horse. With the help from her Qamar Vizir, she feigns illness and her personal doctor advises a three-day diet from the meat of  black horse. After hearing this, the shah is in a dilemma: to save his queen, whose life is more valuable than an animal, he must kill the horse and deeply hurt his own son. He decides on killing the colt, and finding another horse for his son.
Malik Khorsheed goes to the stables and talks to his Black Colt, which talks to him about the grim fate that awaits it, on the very orders of his father, the shah. Black Colt reveals the new queen's deception, and laments that the boy could not do convince his father to the contrary. The horse, however, concocts a plan: the next day, when the clock strikes ten, the horse will neigh to draw his attention, and Malik Khorsheed must leave school, and ask his father for one last ride on the horse.
The next day, the colt is guided to the sacrifice, to the queen's delight. Meanwhile, Malik Khorsheed escapes from his mentor's classes by throwing a handful of ashes on his mouth to stop him, and runs to the palace's gardens, but reaches the wrong side. He jumps over a low wall and runs to his horse. He stops the execution in the nick of time and demands an explanation from the servants. The servants explain that the shah, his father, ordered the horse's execution for the sake of the queen's health. Saddened, the prince asks them to allow him a last ride on the horse.
The guards and servants give him a bridle and a saddle. Malik Khorsheed mounts the horse and they escape from the palace by jumping aloft, high in the air. The shah and the queen watch the whole scene as rider and mount disappear into the air, far away from the kingdom.
Malik Khorsheed and the Black Colt watch the whole world in their aerial flight, passing through mountains and valleys, even the peaks of ""purple Elburz Mountains"". They finally land in the lands of the Shah of Western Persia, and the Black Colt tells him that they must depart for a while, but the animal will help him: it lets the prince take some hairs from its tail, which he can use to summon him by burning them. Black Colt also advises the prince to hide his royal clothes and to find a new identity in this new land, then departs.
Malik Khorsheed follows the horse's instructions and hides the royal garments in a saddlebag, then asks a goatherd on the road for a goat's stomach to wear as a cap, so that he appears to be bald. He reaches the city of the Shah of Western Persia and finds work as the apprentice of the shah's gardener, tending to the flowers of the royal gardens.
At certain times, the weather is so hot that people take a nap in the afternoon, and Malik Khorsheed takes the opportunity to ride the Black Colt while no one is paying attention. So he burns the horse's hairs to summon it, rides it for a while, then returns to his daily duties.
One day, he gives a suggestion to the gardener if he can redesign the garden's flower-beds. He does and so impressive they look that they become the people's talk. Another task the boy does is to bring bouquets for the three princesses along with a written poem for each of them. The youngest princess, beautiful Peri-zaad (""Fairy-born""), decides to look into the recent changes in her father's garden, and goes down to the garden to inquire the gardener. The old gardener replies to the princess that his new apprentice is responsible for the changes. The princess amazes at the boy's sensibility, despite his strange and ugly looks.
She then talks to the gardener's apprentice, the baldheaded boy, who is tending some flowers in the garden. As the princess talks to him, he notices her great beauty, but regains his composture and tells her he is a friendless youth who wandered into her father's city. Intrigued by the gardener's manners, the princess returns to talk to him, and she begins to pine for the lowly boy.
Some time later, the princesses' marriageability is assessed by analysing the ripeness of three melons. The king then summons all noble born youths to his palace for his three daughters to choose her husbands by throwing a red apple to her suitor of choice. Peri-zaad looks to the crowd of assembled noblemen in hopes of seeing the gardener, but he is not there. Her elders sisters choose the sons of the Vizier of the Right Hand and the Vizier of the Left Hand for their husband, while Peri-zaad tries to hold on to hers for a bit longer.
The shah grows impatient with his daughter's indecision, and secretly orders the guards to bring every youth in the city. The guards first stop by the garden to bring the gardener's apprentice to the palace. As soon as the boy appears the royal chambers, the princess is delighted at his arrival, and tosses her red apple to him, mucn to her father's horror at her choosing a lowly man as her husband.
The shah congratulates his two elder daughter and banishes Peri-zaad from the palace for this affront, as well as strips her of her royal rank and privileges. Peri-zaad seems happy with her choice, even if Malik notices that she sacrificed her royal status for him. Malik questions her decision, but the princess answers he was her choice, and goes to live with him in his shabby cottage.
Some time into their marriage life, Malik rides Black Colt away from the cottage, but Peri-zaad sees her husband in the distance as if he is a completely different man. When he returns from his secret ride, the princess inquires him about his origins, and he tells her everythin: the horse's help, his step-mother's plans, and his flight to her father's kingdom. They agree to keep it his true identity a secret for now before it arises any suspicions.
Some time later, the princess's nurse goes to Malik's cottage to tell her about her father's illness, and how his two sons-in-law are hunting for venison to use in a healing broth. Peri-zaad then asks her husband to ride Black Colt and find deer for her father. Meanwhile, the two other sons-in-law ride as far away to Eastern Persia and find a herd of deer. They see that the deers are grazing near a splendid tent, which they learn belongs to Shah-zadeh Malik Khorsheed.
The two princes are brought to Malik's presence and they do not recognize him the gardener's apprentice. The duo tell him they are looking for a cure for their king. Malik agrees to let them take some venison from his herds, but in exchange they will allow him to brand them as his slaves. Both men are perplexed at first, but, thinking no one will ever know beyond the three of them, they consent to be branded and take the venison back to Western Persia.
Malik thanks his loyal horse, Black Colt, for the idea, and rides it back to his wife before the other. He arrives at his cottage and gives her the venison to prepare a broth for her father. Moments later, the two other princes arrive with the deer meat and prepare them. Three bowls with broth are brought before the king: the first one tasteless, the second one heavily seasoned, but the third, by Peri-zaad and Malik, on point. He eats the broth with meat her daughter brought and asks his guards to bring her to him.
The guards go to the gardener's cottage, but do not find neither the princess nor her husband. They decide to leave the palace to begin a search for them all around the country, but as soon as they leave the palace gates, they see a magnificent palace just two miles from the shah's own: Qasr-e-zar-negaar (""The Gold-Pictured Palace""). Certainly - they think - a fairy prince has come to visit them.
The shah is alerted of this and receives their guest with the appropriate pomp. Their guest, Shah-zadeh Malik Khorsheed, enters his father-in-law's palace in regal garments and riding on Black Colt. In the royal chambers, he explains he has come to get his two slaves, the shah's two sons-in-law. The shah does not understand the motive of the prince's visit, until he summons his sons-in-law and they disrobe to show the slave brands.
Malik Khorsheed then invites the shah to his palace, Qasr-e-zar-negaar, for a banquet, where they are to discuss the delivery of the two slaves to him. The shah agrees and the next day he goes with a retinue of courtiers to Qasr-e-zar-negaar. Every room they enter, they admire the exquisite architecture and craftmanship, until they reach the throne room. Malik Khorsheed arrives with a veiled Peri-zaad at his side. The princess makes a bow before her father and lifts her veil to show her face to him.
The shah rejoices at seeing his daughter again, and learns of Malik Khorsheed's whole story. The shah begs for their forgiveness, and embraces Malik as his son-in-law. However, Malik tells him he still misses his homeland, in Eastern Persia, and wishes to bring his wife, Peri-zaad, with him. The shah is sad to part with his daughter, by gives the couple his blessing and they depart the next morning on Black Colt, flying all the way from Western Persia to Eastern Persia.
Back in Eastern Persia, Malik's father has been mourning his son after his departure, and banished his wicked new wife on a horse. A servant comes to him with the strangest news: a flying horse is coming to their kingdom! Hearing this, the king hopes - and prays - it is Black Colt, bringing home his son. The horse lands in the palace's gardens with Malik and the princess. The king is exultant to get his son back, and orders a 40-day feast to be held.
On the last night of festivities, a servant comes to tell Malik that his steed, Black Colt, has disappared from the stables. Hurt by the news of his friend's departure, he goes to the stables and finds no trace of the horse, save for a mat with some of its black hairs on it. Malik squats down to pick them up and hears the steed's voice, as if in a dream, telling him they must separate, but, should the prince need his steed, he just has to burn the hairs, and Black Colt will come at once. Malik is grateful for this one last gift."

","A dying queen made her husband promise to hide her sons from the new queen by raising them in an island on a lake. When the king remarried, a henwife told the stepmother she knew a secret, and when the queen paid her richly, told her of her stepsons, and demanded that they be brought to court.  The henwife gave the queen cards and told her to play with the stepsons for a geasa.  The queen defeated her older two stepsons, but the youngest won.  She set a geasa that the older two must steal: the Knight of the Glen's wild Steed of Bells.  The youngest said that he will go with his brother, and set a geasa that she stand on a tower with her face to the wind, with a sheaf of corn to eat and water to drink, until they returned.
The princes met the Black Thief of Sloan, who warned them of the danger but came with them.  When they tried to steal the horse, it rang the bells so that it warned the Knight and they were caught.
The knight took them to a furnace, to boil them, from the oldest to the youngest of the princes, and then the Black Thief.  The Black Thief said that he had once been in more danger than the oldest and escaped with his life.  The Knight said that if he told him that story, he would pardon the oldest son.  The Black Thief told that he had once seen three witches going to sleep with their gold under the heads to keep the Black Thief from stealing it; he had put turf under their heads instead and gone off with the gold.  They chased him as a greyhound, a hare, and a hawk.  He climbed a tree.  They changed themselves into a smith's anvil and a piece of iron, which the third one made a hatchet of, and she started to cut down the tree.  But just then, a cock crowed and they disappeared.
The knight pardoned the oldest son and set about to boil the second.
The Black Thief said he might yet escape, and the knight said that if he had been in another such great danger, he would pardon the second.  The Black Thief told he had heard how a rich bishop had been buried with jewels and rich robes, and he went to rob the grave.  He heard footsteps and lost courage.  Then he met with a dark figure, which he shot at, and found it was one of the clergy, who had already rifled the tomb.  Some guards came.  He held up the body, and the guards shot at it, and ran into the tomb to ensure he had no others with him.  The Black Thief escaped once they were past him.
The knight pardoned the second son and said he would pardon the youngest for yet another such tale.
The Black Thief told how he had once come to a castle where a woman held a child and wept.  She told him that a giant lived there and had ordered her to kill the child and cook it in a pie.  He killed her a pig and had her cut off a finger; then she baked the pie.  When the giant returned, the woman had him hid in a room where the giant kept corpses.  The giant doubted the pie, but the woman showed him the finger.  Being not full, he went to cut off some meat from the corpses, and cut off some from the thief.  He did not cry out, and the giant got drunk and slept.  He blinded it but could not kill it.  The giant threw a ring after him, and it leapt on his toe, where it called out whenever the giant did.  The thief cut off the toe and threw it into a fishpond, where it called to the giant, who followed and drowned.
An old woman told the knight that he was the baby and she the woman, and the thief the man who had saved his life.  They told the knight why they had to get the horse, and to spare their lives, he gave him it.  The queen heard them coming, and threw herself from the tower and died."

The Irishman saw the same castle and went to it, but when the lady gave him food, he stared about the castle and did not eat. When she asked, he said he could not eat without knowing who she was or where she came from, or how she came there.

He tried to obey her, but the horse's hoof just grazed the wall. The sound was too soft to wake the witch. In the morning, the witch chased after him on her six-winged horse, but only caught him when he was near his own land and did not fear her. She cursed the prince, saying nothing would save him from his brothers.
The third prince found his brothers sleeping and slept by them but they stole his apples and threw him over a cliff. He fell to a dark kingdom. There, a dragon demanded a beautiful maiden every year, and this year the lot had fallen on the kingdom’s princess. The knight said he would save the princess if the king would promise to do as the youth asked; the king promised not only that but to marry him to the princess as well. They went to where the dragon was coming and he went to sleep, telling the princess to wake him. The dragon came, she could not wake the prince and began to weep, and a tear fell on his face, waking him. The youth cut off the dragon's heads, put them under a rock, and threw its body in the sea.
Another man sneaked up behind him and cut off the third prince’s head. The assassin threatened to kill the princess if she would not say that he had killed the dragon. The king arranged for the marriage, but the princess went to sea with fishermen. Each time they caught a fish, she had them throw it back, but finally, their nets caught the third prince's body and head. She put them back together and used the water of life on them. The prince comforted her and sent her home, saying he would come and make it right. He came and asked the king whether the alleged dragon slayer could find the dragon's heads. The imposter could not, but the prince could. The prince said he wanted only to go to his own country, not to marry the princess, but she did not want to be parted from him. She knew a spoonbilled bird that could carry them, if it had enough to eat. They went off with a whole ox, but it was not quite enough; the princess cut off part of her thigh to feed it. The bird carried them all the way and commented on the sweetness of the last piece of meat.  She showed it what she had done, and it spat the piece back out; the prince used the water of life to restore it.
The third prince went back with his father, used the water of life, and told him what his two brothers had done. The brothers were so frightened they jumped in the river. The knight married the princess."

A year later, the king's other four queens convince the newly crowned one that the king may give her a kettle drum to inform the time of labour is approaching. The fifth queen sounds the kettle-drum three times to see if the king comes to her. He does on the first two occasions, but on the third he is absent, which creates a window of opportunity for the other queens to replace her son for a stone and deliver the baby to a nurse to kill him.

The nurse takes the boy in a box and buries it in the jungle, but the king's royal hound, named Shankar, goes to the hole and swallows the boy (but does not eat him). The dog takes the boy and rears him for a time. His master, the king's dogkeeper, sees the boy after the dog spits him out and marvels at the boy's beauty. The four queens learn that the boy is still alive and demand the dog to be killed come morning. The dog, however, saves the boy by giving him to the king's cow Suri, who swallows the boy in its belly.

The four queens once again learn of the boy's survival and order the cow to be sacrificed, but the boy is saved by the cow, who delivers him to the king's horse, Katar. The news of his survival reach the four queens' ears, who beg the king to sacrifice the horse. When a cadre of the king's sypoys surround the barn, the horse tells the prince to get some princely clothes, a bridle, a saddle, a sword and a gun from the stable, and ride it to escape execution.

The boy and Katar reach another country and exchange their clothes for common disguises, and the horse becomes a donkey. The prince with a moon takes up a job as a grain merchant's apprentice. On one hot day, the boy begins to sing to pass the time, and the local king's seventh daughter listens to the song. The princess goes to the royal garden, located neat the grain merchant's shop, and inquires the youth about his origins. He evades her questions. The princess insists on knowing about him, and this time he answers he is only a poor boy.

The king gathers a royal assemblage in the royal gardens, where the princess is to select her betrothed, and she chooses the grain merchant's apprentice.

After their marriage, the princess feels a bit saddened that her intended does not join with her sisters' husbands in hunting game around the palace. The prince consults with the magic horse Katar (shaped like a donkey), and they transform back into a gallant prince and a horse. The duo hunt birds and deers, and stop to rest under a tree. The other six brothers-in-law come and see him in the guise of the prince with a moon and a star, and beg him for food and drink. The prince agrees, so long as the six other men suffer a red-hot iron scar on their backs.

The prince returns to the palace in his true form, to everyone's surprise. He tells the truth to his wife, who accepts him as her husband.

Some days after, the prince asks the king if he has any sons. The prince reveals the whole truth to his father, and shows him the magic horse Katar, who has helped the prince so far.

The oldest daughter said that if he married her, she would bake him a loaf of bread that would make him young and brave forever; the second one said, if one married her, she would make him a shirt that would protect him in any fight, even with a dragon, and against heat and water; the youngest one said that she would bear him twin sons with stars on their foreheads. The emperor married the youngest, and two of his friends married the other two.The emperor's stepmother had wanted him to marry her daughter and so hated his new wife. She got her brother to declare war on him, to get him away from her, and when the empress gave birth in his absence, killed and buried the twins in the corner of the garden and put puppies in their place. The emperor punished his wife to show what happened to those who deceived the emperor.
Two aspens grew from the grave, putting on years' growth in hours.  The stepmother wanted to chop them down, but the emperor forbade it. Finally, she convinced him, on the condition that she had beds made from the wood, one for him and one for her.  In the night, the beds began to talk to each other.  The stepmother had two new beds made, and burned the originals. While they were burning, the two brightest sparks flew off and fell into the river.  They became two golden fish.  When fishermen caught them, they wanted to take them alive to the emperor.  The fish told them to let them swim in dew instead, and then dry them out in the sun.  When they did this, the fish turned back into babies, maturing in days.
Wearing lambskin caps that covered their hair and stars, they went to their father's castle and forced their way in. Despite their refusal to take off their caps, the emperor listened to their story, only then removing their caps. The emperor executed his stepmother and took back his wife."
the_bronze_ring,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronze_Ring,The Bronze Ring,"""The Bronze Ring"" is the first story in The Blue Fairy Book by Andrew Lang. According to Lang's preface, this version of this fairy tale from the Middle East or Central Asia was translated and adapted from Traditions Populaires de l'Asie Mineure by Carnoy et Nicolaides (Paris: Maison-neuve, 1889).

","The king despairs because his castle is surrounded by wasteland, instead of a fruitful garden. Advised that the remedy is a head gardener ""whose forefathers were also gardeners"", he finds such a man. Under this gardener's care the land does flourish, but a new problem arises.
The princess loves the gardener's son – and will marry no one else. After she refuses her father's choice of a husband (the prime minister's son), he contrives a contest to settle the matter: the two men must go to a far destination and the first to return shall marry the princess. They do not go off on an equal footing. The minister's son is equipped with a fine horse and gold, while the gardener's son is given a lame horse and copper. Traveling swiftly, the minister's son encounters a woman in rags. Weak and starving, she begs for his help. He spurns her.
The gardener's son then encounters the woman. Generously, he gives her his purse and invites her to ride behind him. At the next city, heralds announce that the sultan is sick, and that whoever cures him can name the reward. The woman, who is a witch, instructs the boy: find and slay three particular dogs, burn them and collect their ashes, then make way to the sultan. Place the dying sultan in a cauldron over a roaring fire, and boil him right down to his bones. Finally, arrange the bones properly and scatter the dogs' ashes over them. The gardener's son does all these things and the sultan revives, in full hearty youth. Exactly as the witch suggested, the gardener's son chooses the bronze ring for his reward and will accept nothing else. This ring contains a djinni who grants any wish. Now the gardener's son continues his journey in a fabulous sailing ship, with a cargo of gems, sails of brocade and a hull of gold, crewed by a dozen handsome sailors, each dressed as richly as a king – all gifts of the bronze ring.
Eventually he meets his rival, who has spent all his fortune. Unrecognized, the gardener's son offers to supply his rival with a ship - on the condition that the skin of his back be branded with the imprint of the bronze ring, heated in a fire. Once that is done, the gardener's son asks the ring to prepare a ship with half-rotten timbers painted black, ragged sails and a maimed and sickly crew. In this ship the prime minister's son returns, and claims his bride from the king.
As the unhappy princess' wedding is being prepared, the king looks out on the harbor and wonders at the gleaming gold ship sailing into it. He is so taken by the sight of its captain (the gardener's son) that he invites him to the wedding and, after closer inspection, actually invites him to give away the bride. The gardener's son agrees, but when he sees the intended groom he objects, telling the king that the man is not worthy of the princess, being nothing more than his own slave. The prime minister's son denies this, but the brand of the bronze ring on his back serves as proof of the claim. The gardener's son marries the delighted princess that day with the king's blessing. They have a short period of happiness.
Meanwhile, a student of the black arts has come to learn about the djinni of the bronze ring. When the prince sails off for a trip in his golden ship, he persuades the princess to trade him the ring for some red fish. Once he has the ring, he wishes the prince's boat from gold into rotten wood, his crew from princely appearing men into hideous slaves, and the cargo of gems into ravenous black cats. (In the original French source, the magician is a Jew and the debased crew become Negroes. Modern editions of the Blue Fairy Book tend to omit these details.)Realizing that an enemy must now have his bronze ring, the prince sails on until he comes to an island inhabited by mice. The Mouse Queen sends an envoy to ask that the ship sail away with its terrible cargo of cats. The prince agrees, on the condition that his bronze ring be found and returned to him. The Mouse Queen contacts all the mice of the world, three of whom know that the magician keeps the bronze ring in his pocket when awake, and in his mouth when asleep. The three go to retrieve the ring. One of them tickles the sleeping magician's nose with her tail, and he expels the ring from his mouth with a sneeze. After some misadventures, the mice manage to return the ring to the prince, who restores his golden vessel and hurries home to the princess. He captures the magician and has the man broken into pieces by being tied to the tail of a savage mule."
the_brown_bear_of_norway,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway,The Brown Bear of Norway,"The Brown Bear of Norway is an Irish fairy tale collected by Patrick Kennedy which appeared in his Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (1866). It was later included by Andrew Lang in his anthology The Lilac Fairy Book (1910), though Lang misattributed his source as West Highland Tales (cf. The Brown Bear of the Green Glen).","A king in Ireland asked his daughters whom they wanted to marry. The oldest wanted the king of Ulster, the second the king of Munster, and the youngest the Brown Bear of Norway. That night, the youngest princess woke to find herself in a grand hall, and a handsome prince on his knees before her, asking her to marry him. They were married at once, and the prince explained that a witch had transformed him into a bear to get him to marry her daughter. Now that she had married him, he would be freed if she endured five years of trials.
They had three children in succession, but an eagle, a greyhound, and a lady took each one, and the princess, after losing the last child, told her husband that she wanted to visit her family. He told her that to return, she had only to wish it while lying down at night, and the next morning, she would wake in her old bed. She told her family her tale, and while she did not want to lose any more children, she was certain it was not her husband's fault, and she missed him. A woman told her to burn his bear fur, and then he would have to be a man both night and day. She stopped drinking a drink he gave her before she went to bed, and woke up and burned his fur. The man woke and told her that now he had to marry a witch's daughter; it had been the witch who had given her that advice.
The princess chased after her husband, and just as the night fell, they both reached a little house. A little boy played before the hearth, and her husband told her that the boy was their son, and the woman whose house it was, was the eagle who had carried the boy away. The woman made them welcome, and her husband gave her a pair of scissors, that would turn anything they cut into silk. He told her he would forget her during the day, but remember at night. At the second night, they found a house with their daughter, and he gave her a comb that would make pearls and diamonds fall from her hair.
At the third night, they found a house with their third child, and he gave her a hand-reel with golden thread that has no end, and half their wedding ring. He told her that once he entered a wood the next day, he would forget her and the children utterly, unless she reached his home and put her half of the ring to his. The wood tried to keep her out, but she commanded it, by the gifts she bore, to let her in, and found a great house and a woodman's cottage nearby. She went to the cottage and persuaded the woodman and his wife to take her as their servant, saying she would take no wages, but give them silk, diamonds, pearls, and golden thread whenever they wanted. She heard that a prince had come to live at the witch's castle.
The servants at the castle annoyed her with their attentions. She invited the head footman, the most persistent, and asked him to pick her some honeysuckle; when he did, she used the gifts she bore to give him horns and make him sing back to the great house. His fellow servants made mock of him until she let the charm drop. The prince, having heard of this, went to look at her and was puzzled by the sight. The witch's daughter came and saw the scissors, and the princess would only exchange them for a night outside the prince's chamber. She took the night and could not wake the prince, and the head footman ridiculed her as he put her out again. She tried again, with the comb, to no better success.
The third day, the prince did not merely look at her but stopped to ask if he could do anything for her, and she asked if he heard anything in the night. He said he had thought he heard singing in his dreams. She asked him if he had drunk anything before he slept, and when he said he had, she asked him to not drink it. That night, bargained for with the reel, she sang, and the prince roused. The princess was able to put the half-rings together, and he regained his memory. The castle fell apart, and the witch and her daughter vanished. The prince and the princess soon regained their children and set out for their own castle."
the_brown_bear_of_the_green_glen,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brown_Bear_of_the_Green_Glen,The Brown Bear of the Green Glen,"""The Brown Bear of the Green Glen"" is a Scottish fairy tale collected by John Francis Campbell in Popular Tales of the West Highlands, listing his informant as John MacDonald, a ""Traveling Tinker"". He also noted the parallels with The Water of Life.

","A king was losing his sight and his ability to walk.  His oldest two set out for water to cure him.  The youngest son, John, known as a fool, set out too, and found his brothers in the first town.  He went on.  He climbed a tree to spend the night, but a bear with an ember in its mouth came and got him down by threatening to climb up.  The bear caught a deer and fed him the cooked meat.  In the morning, it had him ride it.  Every night, it had him stay with a giant by saying that the brown bear of the green glen had sent him, but the third giant wrestled with him.  As the bear had directed, when the giant had him down, he said that if the brown bear of the green glen were there, it would not go well with him; the bear appeared.
The giant ordered a sheep carcass laid before the door.  He told John that an eagle would eat it, and he was to cut the wart from its ear without drawing a drop of blood.  The prince did so and the eagle carried him off to the Green Island for the water to cure his father.  There, he got the water, and also a whiskey bottle that never emptied, a loaf that grew no smaller when slices were cut off, and a cheese that was the same; he also kissed a sleeping beautiful woman.
The eagle carried him back.  He showed the giant the whiskey bottle, and the giant offered him money, a saddle and bridle for it.  He agreed, but said the giant must give it to his sweetheart, if she came.  The giant agreed.  The next two giants, he sold the bread and cheese under the same conditions.  He met his brothers in the town and told them to come home, but they set on him to kill him and stole the water.  He recovered and called to a smith traveling by, who threw him into his cart.  The iron got into his wounds and made him rough-skinned and bald.
The woman John had kissed gave birth to a son.  A henwife gave her a bird that would jump to the head of the baby's father on seeing him.  She set out, got the whiskey, the cheese, and the bread, and reached the king.  She told him what had happened.  The king had every man appear before her, but the bird did not jump on any of them.  The king demanded if there were anyone else; the smith told of a rough-skinned servant, and John was brought.  The bird jumped on him.  The king knew him for his son, and asked what should be done to his brothers.  John described what they had done to him, and married the princess."
the_canary_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canary_Prince,The Canary Prince,"The Canary Prince is an Italian fairy tale, the 18th tale in Italian Folktales by Italo Calvino. He took the tale from Turin, making various stylistic changes; he noted it developed a medieval motif, but such tales as Marie de France's Yonec produced a rather different effect, being tales of adultery. A variant on Rapunzel, Aarne–Thompson type 310, The Maiden in the Tower, it includes many motifs that differentiate it from that tale. Other fairy tales of this type include Anthousa, Xanthousa, Chrisomalousa, Petrosinella, Prunella, and Rapunzel.

","A jealous stepmother persuades her husband, the king, to lock his daughter in a castle in the forest. One day, a king's son goes by, hunting, and is astounded to see the abandoned castle in use. He sees the daughter, but they are unable to communicate except by gesture. A witch, to help them, tricks the ladies-in-waiting into giving the princess a book. When she ruffles the pages forward, her lover turns into a canary; when she ruffles them back, he is restored to his human form.
After some time, the queen arrives and sees a young man by the window, and puts pins on the window sill so that if the daughter leaned on it to flirt, she would be stabbed.  These pins stab the prince in his canary form, and even when the princess restores him, the prince lies on the ground, bleeding, and his companions must bear him back to his father. The princess escapes by cutting up her sheets for a rope, and overhears witches talking of things; one describes how to heal the prince. She does so, and asks for his coat-of-arms, his standard, and his vest as her reward.
He goes hunting, and she turns him into a canary. When he flies to her room and she turns him back, he reproaches her for his injury. She produces her reward to prove that she saved him, and tells him that it was her stepmother's doing. They marry, and the daughter reveals to her father how wicked her imprisonment had been."

It is Aarne–Thompson type 1161, The Bear Trainer and His Cat.

","A man was bringing a white bear to give to the king of Denmark, and he came to the mountain Dovre on Christmas Eve and asked a man called Halvor for shelter for the night.  Halvor told him that trolls came to every Christmas Eve and made such havoc that the household had to flee them.  The man said he would stay with his bear anyway.
The trolls came, eating the feast the people had left behind, and one began to bait the bear, calling it ""Kitty"".  It rose and drove them all out of the house.
The next year, a troll asked Halvor if he still had that cat.  Halvor assured him that he did, and she had had seven kittens, bigger and fiercer than herself.  The trolls never again came to his cottage for Christmas Eve."

","A queen told an old woman that she had two griefs:  a new one, that her husband was at war, and an old one, that they had no children.  She gave her a basket with an egg:  the queen was to put it somewhere warm.  In three months, it would break and let out a doll.  She was to let it alone, and then it would become a baby girl.  She would have a baby of her own, a son, and she was to put the girl with him and show them both to the king, and then raise the son herself but entrust the daughter to a nurse.  Furthermore, she must invite this woman to the christening by throwing a wild goose feather into the air.
The queen obeyed exactly.  When the christening arrived, a dazzlingly beautiful woman came in a cream-colored carriage, and was dressed like the sun.  She decreed that the girl was to be named Dotterine.
The children grew.  Dotterine's nurse loved her, but knew that every night a beautiful woman leaned over her; she confided in the queen, and they decided to keep it secret.  When the twins were two, the queen took ill and confided the basket to the nurse, for when Dotterine was ten.  Then she died.
The king remarried, for reasons of ambition, and the stepmother hated the twins.  One day, she beat Dotterine, and Dotterine ran away to weep.  She found the basket, thought something in it might amuse her, and found only a feather.  She threw it out the window.  A beautiful woman appeared and told her that she was her godmother; she talked with her, told her how to use the basket to feed herself, and said that to summon her, she need only throw the goose wing out the window.
One day, the city was besieged.  Dotterine threw the goose wing out the window.  The lady carried her away.  The next day, the king and all his men were captured, but the prince escaped in the confusion, and his hard-hearted stepmother was killed by a spear.
The lady disguised Dotterine as a peasant.  She used the basket to feed herself but took service as a peasant to gain shelter.  One day a lady saw her and took her into service.  She heard that the prince had raised an army and threw out the usurper who had taken the city, but the king had died in captivity.  The new king held a ball to choose his wife.  Her godmother told her to prepare her mistresses; once they were gone, she told her to look in the basket.  She found all she needed there and went to the ball.  All the women said that this was the lost princess.
At midnight, a dark cloud blinded them, and Dotterine's godmother appeared.  She told the king that Dotterine had never been his sister by birth, she was, instead, a princess from a neighboring kingdom, entrusted to his mother by her to raise to protect her from an evil wizard.  She vanished, and so did the basket, but Dotterine lived happily with the king ever after."

Boulane returns to ascertain the birth of their children, and is told that the queen gave birth to an animal. Morongoé is demoted and the second co-wife becomes the queen.

One day, the new queen walks by Morongoé's hut and sees a boy with the full moon on his chest, playing with the rats. The second queen asks Boulane to burn Morongoé's hut for fear of the rats.

He climbs up the tree and beckons his daughters to come near the apple tree. The three sisters fall into the hole, and their father returns home.
Deep in the hole, they begin to feel hungry and the elder and middle sisters offer themselves to the others. The youngest, however, prays to God for an answer and her hands turn into a pickaxe and a spade. She excavates an exit out of the hole and reaches the king's stables. She steals the horses' fodder of almonds and raisins and takes them back to her sisters. One day, the horse groom notices that the horses are looking emaciated and investigates the matter. He discovers the girl stealing the horses' food and alerts the king.
The horse groom takes the three sisters to the king's court, who inquires them about their skills: the eldest claims she can weave a large carpet to accommodate the whole kingdom and then some; the middle one that she can cook a meal in an egg-shell for the whole kingdom, and the third sister promises to give birth to twin children, a boy and a girl with golden locks (""Goldschopf"", in Dirr's text). The king marries the third sister and she gives birth to twins, but her jealous sisters replace the children for puppies and cast them in the sea in a box. The king then orders his wife to be bound in the castle gates, and for citizens to spit at and throw soot at her.

They join the feast and tell the guests that the woman at the gate is their mother. The king refuses to believe the two, until the boy produces a branch of dried vine. The boy then proclaims that the dried vine will spring to life and yield grapes, and that a roasted pheasant will come to life, perch on the branch and spread its wings. It happens so, thus proving their parentage. The king embraces his children, reinstates his wife and punishes the sisters-in-law."

The nobleman tried to intimidate the servant by warning him that Seoul was a vicious place where it was easy to have one’s nose sliced off alive. During their journey, the servant came up with cunning ways to play pranks on his master. When delivering a meal, he said his snot accidentally fell into the soup as he stirred it in front of his master, which disgusted the master enough to give the food away to the servant. With another meal, the servant presented it with a burning hot spoon that made the master yelp in surprise and pain, allowing the servant to take the food away to enjoy it himself. Once, the servant secretly ate his master’s lunch, relieved himself in the lunch box, and told his master that the food had gone stale and turned into feces.
Upon arriving in Seoul, the master went out on business. The servant left behind sold the horse and sat with his eyes shut and hands covering his nose. When the master asked where the horse was upon his return, the servant said he didn’t realize the horse was gone for he was worried that someone might slice his nose off now that they were in Seoul. The furious master wrote the message “Drown him when he returns” on the servant’s back and sent him home. On his way back to his master’s house in the countryside, the servant tricked a woman milling into giving him some green barley. He also tricked a merchant selling honey into making honey-filled rice cakes with the green barley.

He tried to hide his money in the donkey's mane so that it would not be stolen.  When the donkey shook its head and let the money drop, the shoemaker claimed that the donkey could produce money from nowhere. The thieves bought the donkey for fifty gold pieces, and the shoemaker told them that they must each keep it one night apiece, to avoid quarrels over the money.  One by one, the robbers learned they had been tricked but said nothing, so the others would be fooled, too.  Finally, they all spoke to each other and decided to get revenge on the shoemaker.
The shoemaker saw them coming and had his wife put a bladder of blood  around her neck.  When the thieves arrived, he told them he would give them the money and told his wife to get it.  When she lagged, he stabbed the bladder, and she fell down as if dead.  Then he played the guitar and she got up, and the robbers bought the guitar for forty more gold pieces.  Each one stabbed his wife and unsuccessfully tried to revive her.
They set out after the shoemaker again. He told his wife to free the dog when they arrived and to tell the robbers she sent it to retrieve her husband. Then the shoemaker hid in a vineyard. When the thieves arrived, the wife did as she was told. After she freed the dog, the shoemaker returned to the house. The robbers bought the dog from him for forty more gold pieces.  When each one freed it in turn, though, it merely ran back to the shoemaker.
Finally, the robbers put the man in a bag and lugged him to the sea, but first they rested in a church because it was hot.  A swineherd with a herd of pigs came by, and the shoemaker told that he was in the bag because they wanted him to marry the king's daughter and he wouldn't.  The swineherd traded places with him, the shoemaker left with the pigs, and the robbers threw the bag into the sea.  When the thieves later saw the shoemaker with the herd of pigs, he told them there were pigs in the sea and they had to tie a stone around their necks to make sure they reached those depths.

The second said that if she married the keeper of the royal wardrobe, she would dress the entire court in one piece of cloth, and have some left over. The youngest said that if she married the king, she would bear two sons with apples in their hands, and a daughter with a star on her forehead.

The ring changed colors. His brother came after him, but suffered the same fate. Their sister came after them both, said nothing, and transformed her brother and many other statues back to life.

They returned home, and the king saw them and thought that if he did not know his wife had given birth to three puppies, he would think these his children. They invited him to dinner, and the Speaking Bird told the king all that had happened. The king executed the aunts and their nurse and took his wife and children back to the palace."

the_devil_with_the_three_golden_hairs,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_With_the_Three_Golden_Hairs,The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs,"""The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs"" (German: Der Teufel mit den drei goldenen Haaren) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 29). It falls under Aarne–Thompson classification types 461 (""three hairs from the devil""), and 930 (""prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl"").The story was first translated into English as ""The Giant and the Three Golden Hairs"" to avoid offense, but the devil in the story does indeed act like a folklore giant.Ruth Manning-Sanders included it, as ""The Three Golden Hairs of the King of the Cave Giants"", in A Book of Giants.

","A poor woman gave birth to a son with a caul (where the amniotic sac is still intact at birth), which was interpreted to mean that he would marry the king's daughter at fourteen years of age.  The wicked king, hearing of it, visited the family and persuaded them to allow him to bring the boy back and raise him in the castle. Instead, he put the boy in a box and threw the box into the water, so that he would drown and not grow up to marry his daughter. But rather than sink, it drifted down to a mill, where it was found by the miller and his wife. The two decided to raise the boy on their own.
Fourteen years later, the king happened to visit the mill inadvertently. Upon seeing the boy, the king asked the miller if he was his father, who then explained the story of how he and his wife had come to raise the boy. Shocked, the king devised a way to rid himself of the boy once and for all. He gave the young man a sealed letter and instructed him to deliver it to the queen. Inside, the letter commanded that the boy be killed and buried once he arrived.
On his way to deliver the letter, the boy sought shelter in an old woman's house for the night. Despite her warnings that robbers frequented the house, the boy fell asleep, claiming he could walk no further. When the bandits arrived, they read the letter and took pity on the boy. Without waking him, they put a new letter in its place, dictating that the boy should marry the king's daughter upon his arrival. When the morning came, they pointed him in the direction of the castle and he went on his way.
The wedding proceeded, and when the king returned, he dispatched the boy to travel into Hell and return with three of the Devil's golden hairs, in yet another effort to rid himself of his new son-in-law.
The boy is confronted with three questions on his journey, as he travels between two towns and across the river. When passing through each, he is asked his trade (""what he knows""). The boy responds thrice, ""I know everything."" He is then asked why the first town's well, which once sprung forth wine, no longer dispenses even water. In the second town, he is asked why a tree that once produced golden apples will not even sprout leaves. When being ferried across the river, the ferryman asks him why he must always row back and forth, and is not free to do otherwise. To each question he replies, ""You shall know that, only when I come back.""
The boy finds the entrance to Hell on the other side of the river and, upon entering, finds only the Devil's grandmother. He tells her what he wants, and she promises to assist him how she can, turning him into an ant and hiding him in the folds of the clothing. The Devil returns and, despite smelling human flesh in the air, is convinced to sit down, eat, and drink. Once he has done so, he lays his head in his grandmother's lap and falls into an inebriated sleep. She plucks a golden hair from his head three times, causing him to awaken after every hair pulled. Having assumed the pain was part of his dreams, he recounts his visions to his grandmother- a dried-up well in a town square with a toad underneath blocking the flow of liquid, a tree that does not sprout fruit or leaves because of a mouse gnawing at its root, and a ferryman who can be freed merely by placing his oar in the hands of another man on the river's bank.
The next morning, once the Devil had left the dwelling again, the boy was transformed back into his former self. Thanking the old woman, he took the three golden hairs and set off for home. Once again, he passed the river and two cities, disclosing the answers he had overheard the Devil speak of during the night. Each town gives him a pair of asses laden with gold, which he brings back with him to the castle. The king, pleased by the boy's return with such wealth, allows him to live in peace with his wife. He inquires on the source of the wealth he acquired, hoping to find some for himself. The boy tells him the gold was found across the river.
The story ends with the king crossing the river with the ferryman, who hands him the oar upon reaching the other side, condemning him to a life of ferrying travellers back and forth forever."

","A king and queen had several children, but loved them only if they were good and beautiful.  One, Alidor, being ugly, in time left his parents secretly.  More distressed over their reputation than his fate, they sent after him, but he had chosen his path with care and vanished.  He met a young man in service to the King of the Woods and heard of his beautiful daughter Livorette, and so resolved to go there.  Once there, Livorette and all her ladies laughed at his ugliness.  The queen, however, drew him aside and inquired after him.  He soon became a favorite at the court because of his intelligence and courtesy, but Livorette still laughed at him, and being madly in love with her, Alidor soon became melancholy.  Trying to distract himself, he fished, but he caught nothing, and Livorette mocked him for it.  One day, he caught a dolphin.  The dolphin asked him to put it back, promising to help him, and reasoned with him about the princess.  When he freed it, he despaired, but it came back and gave him an abundance of fish.  It then discussed how to win Livorette, saying it would be necessary to deceive her.  He brought back the fish, and then turned himself into a canary.  In this form, he wooed the princess but would not speak to anyone else.
After a night, he persuaded the princess to take him to her parents, where he claimed to be a king of an island.  They agreed.  Alidor visited the court in his own shape, and the queen told him all about the match.  That night, after staying in the princess's bedroom until she slept, he went to the seashore and sat on a rock.  Grognette the fairy, a dwarf, came out and cursed him for sitting on her rock, saying she would make him suffer.
Meanwhile, a prince sent ambassadors to woo Livorette.  She seemed disposed to accept them.  However, she grew ill, and a doctor, hidden from knowledge of her rank, said she was going to have a child.  Soon after, she had a son.  The king decided to have them both killed; the queen managed to have it deferred.  Alidor grew mad with the despair, and the dolphin no longer appeared.
When the baby was four, the king had every man give him a gift.  When Alidor's made the baby reach for him, the king said he was the father and had Alidor, the princess, and the son thrown into the sea in a barrel.  There Alidor, though still mad, summoned the dolphin, and Livorette had him order the dolphin to obey her.  Then she had the dolphin conjure them out of the barrel to a magnificent island, and explain how she came to have a child, and then restore Alidor's sanity and make him handsome.  They landed on the island, and she forgave Alidor his deceit.  The dolphin had them made king and queen of it.
However, Grognette had forbidden her to consider Alidor her husband without her parents' consent.
The queen had learned what the king had ordered for Livorette and reproached him.  At last he confessed that he had had no peace since then.  They consulted a fairy, who sent them to the dolphin's island.  They were shipwrecked, but saved alive.  They could not recognize Alidor, or their daughter, or the child, who made them welcome, but Livorette revealed the truth.  Their marriage was concluded."

Within hours, he became lost in a wood and lost his attendants, and found a girl mocking snails. He fell in love at sight, and the girl, Filadoro, also fell in love with him.

When he heard she had magic, he asked why they could not leave; she answered a conjunction of the stars prevented it, but would go. When the ogress returned in the evening, calling Filadoro to throw down her hair so that she could climb it, the land was ready. The next day, she set him to split seven stacks of wood, and Filadoro did it again.
The third day, the ogress suspected Filadoro and set the prince to empty a cistern. Filadoro said that they must flee and dug a hole to an underground passage and they ran away. The prince did not want to bring her to his palace afoot and dressed this way, so he went to get suitable clothing and a carriage. The ogress cursed him to forget her as soon as he was kissed, and when he reached the castle, his mother kissed him.

Once the dove has flown away, the prince has the kitchen boy who made the pie brought before him.

When the army did not march away, they were soon caught between starving or emerging to face execution. A dragon happened to fly by at this time, however, and offered the three men salvation under the condition that they must serve him for seven years. When they agreed, the dragon, named Westerlies, carried them off. However, the dragon was in fact the Devil. He gave them a whip with which they could make money, but said at the end of seven years, they were his unless they could guess a riddle in which case they would be free and could keep the whip.
At the end of the seven years, two of the soldiers were morose at the thought of their fate. An old woman advised them to go down to a cottage for help. The third soldier, who did not fear the riddle, went down and met the devil's grandmother. She was pleased with his manners and hid him in the cellar. When the devil came, she questioned him, and the soldier learned the answers.
The Devil found them at the end of the seven years, and said he would take them to hell and serve them a meal. The riddle was: what was the meat, the silver spoon, and the wineglass for that meal. The soldiers gave the correct answers: a dead sea-cat in the North Sea, a whale rib, and an old horse's hoof. No longer in the devil's power, the soldiers lived happily ever after thanks to the money-making whip that they kept."

The man, stranded on the island, survived there until Christmas, when he saw a small boat approach, on which were two young women, who were better dressed than the others. The two young maidens saw the man sitting by a bundle of sticks, and one of them, to find out what he was made of, pinched him. As she did, her fingers caught a pin, and it drew blood.

Thus he agreed to married her, and she kept her word, and did provide for them, though he never saw how.
When the man's people returned to fish, they landed on the far side of the island at night. The maiden, now the man's wife, told him not to stir no matter what he heard. A great clatter, like carpentry, arose, and the man nearly jumped up before he remembered. In the morning the man found that a fine house had been built for them.

When he had his hand on the door, he thought he was safe, and looked, but by then half of the cows had vanished. Still, there were enough for them both to be rich.

One day, the young man told him he did not find the women in Flanders beautiful; he did not wish to marry a woman who was pink and white, because he did not find them beautiful. Then, they received a basket of oranges, which they had never seen before, and ate them. The son dreamed of an orchard with trees of such ""golden apples"", which held a princess with golden skin. He set out to find it and marry her.
At night, he stopped at a little hut. There, an old man told him that in a nearby forest was a park, which held a castle, and the orange grove behind it. A witch lived in the castle. He should oil the hinges, feed the dog a loaf of bread, give a baking woman a brush, and take the cord out of a well. Then he should get three oranges and return without touching the oranges until he reached water. Then, each one would be a princess and he could marry whichever one he loved. But having made his choice, he must never leave her.
He obeyed. He heard the witch calling after him, to the things to kill him, but the rope refused because he had kept it from rotting, and so on with the others. But once he escaped, he could not find water, and he opened an orange in hopes of juice. A canary flew out and flew off to find water. Despite himself, he tried a second, and the same thing happened; he fell unconscious. Nighttime revived him, and he reached a stream. There he opened the third, and when the third canary flew out, he gave it water. It became a beautiful princess.
He brought her back, but refused to take her to the castle afoot.  He went ahead to get a carriage and horses. She heard a noise while he was gone and climbed a tree for fear it was a wolf. It was an ugly maidservant who saw the princess' reflection in the pool and took it for her own. She thought she was too beautiful to carry water. She was sent back twice, and the third time, she realized that the reflection was someone else. She spoke to the princess and heard her story. Sticking a pin into her head, the maidservant turned the princess back into a canary. She then told the young man, when he returned, that she had been turned into this. The young man blamed himself.
At the wedding feast, the canary appeared in the kitchen window and enchanted the person cooking the goose, three times, so that each time it burned. The third time, the scullion caught it, and was going to wring its neck, when the lord came down to see what had happened. The lord thought the canary lovely and stroked it, which made him find the pin. He pulled it out, and the princess was unenchanted.

He hung up a silver one instead; and another prince passed but as it was too poor for him, another man came instead to marry her. As a result, the youngest daughter's sisters refused to associate with her.

When she gave birth to a daughter, the fairies blessed the baby with beauty, riches, and having flowers fall from her mouth when she spoke. This reconciled the sisters who married princes with their youngest sister.
When the enchanted maiden had grown up, a prince who was betrothed to a daughter of her aunt fell in love with her and wanted nothing to do with his betrothed. He fell ill, and his physicians ordered him to travel. The enchanted maiden climbed up a tower to watch him go, and the betrothed maiden put out her eyes with a stick. A man gave her shelter, but when the prince returned, his betrothed claimed to be the enchanted maiden, who could not go to him because she was blind. The enchanted maiden told the betrothed that she would give her flowers for her wedding in return for her eyes, so the betrothed girl sent her her eyes. She put them back and went to the wedding to ask the prince not to marry the betrothed girl. The prince asked his guests that after having lost something, bought another, and found the original, whether he should use the new or the old. They recommended the old, and so he married the enchanted maiden."
the_enchanted_pig,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enchanted_Pig,The Enchanted Pig,"The Enchanted Pig (Romanian: Porcul cel fermecat) is a Romanian fairy tale, collected in Rumanische Märchen and also by Petre Ispirescu in Legende sau basmele românilor. Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A king goes to war and tells his daughters they may go anywhere in the castle except one room. One day, they disobey and find a book open in it. It says that the oldest shall marry a prince from the east, the second a prince from the west, and the youngest a pig from the north. The youngest is horror-struck, but her sisters manage to convince her that it is impossible.
The king returns and discovers, from the youngest's unhappiness, what they had done. He resolves to face it as best they can. A prince from the east marries the oldest, and a prince from the west the second, and the youngest becomes distressed. A pig comes to woo her, and when the king would have refused his consent, the city fills with pigs. The king tells his daughter that he is certain there is something strange about this pig, and that he believes magic has been at work. If she were to marry the pig, it might be broken.

She marries the pig and goes off with him. At his home, he becomes a man every night, and is so kind that he wins her heart. She asks a witch what happened to her husband. The witch tells her to tie a thread to his foot to free him.  When the young wife does so, her husband wakes and tells her that the spell would have fallen from him in three days, but now he must remain in this shape, and she will not find him without wearing out three pairs of iron shoes and blunting a steel staff.
She sets out as soon as she gets herself three pairs of iron shoes and a steel staff. She wanders far, until she comes to the house of the Moon. The Moon's mother lets her in, and while she is there, she gives birth to a son.  The Moon's mother tells her that the Moon could not tell her where to find her husband, but she can go on, to the Sun. She also gives her a chicken and tells her to keep every one of the bones. The princess thanks her, throws away one pair of shoes, which was worn out, and puts on another.
She finally wends her way to the Sun's house, and the Sun's mother lets her in. She hides her, because the Sun is always ill-tempered when he returns. He is, but his mother soothes him, and asked about her husband. He cannot tell her, so his mother sends her on, to the Wind. Also, she gives her a chicken and tells her to keep care of the bones. Here, she throws out the second pair of shoes.
At the Wind's house, his mother discovers that her husband lives in a wood no axe could cut through. She sends her to it, with a chicken and instructions to keep every bone. The princess goes on, although her third pair of shoes wears through, on the Milky Way. She finds the castle where her husband lives, and the bones stick together to form her a ladder to let her in. She is one bone short, and cuts off her little finger to complete the ladder. Her husband returns, and the spell on him is broken.
He reveals that he is a prince, who had killed a dragon, and the dragon's mother, a witch, had turned him to that shape and then advised her to tie the string to keep him in it. They set out to his father's kingdom, and then return to her father's kingdom."

It belongs to the ATU tale type 554, The Grateful Animals.

","A poor cabinet-maker and his wife have two sons. They favour their eldest son called Hellmerich who's arrogant and selfish, but that they see him as brave and courageous, while his youngest called Hans, who's good and kind hearted, is seen by his parents as stupid. 
One day after making no sales, the cabinet-maker stops at an inn and overhears a conversation going on between two men saying that the Princess has been kidnapped and placed under a spell in the castle by an evil sorcerer. Whichever man accepts the challenge must complete three hard tasks, but if he succeeds he will be given the Princess' hand in marriage and win the Sorcerer's treasures. The cabinet-maker immediately returns to tell his family and asks Hellmerich to attempt this challenge. The eldest son agrees and his father uses his last savings to buy him a horse, armour and a sword. After saying goodbye to his family, he rides away into the distance. He goes through a forest that surrounds the Sorcerer's castle. As he rides through the forest, he  tramples an anthill, kills some ducks near a pond, and destroys a beehive, leaving the bees homeless.
He eventually reaches the castle and bangs on the door impatiently. An old woman comes out and tells him to come back to the castle at nine o'clock. Angrily, Hellmerich spends the night in the forest. The next morning, he returns to the castle and the old woman appears with a basket full of seeds. She scatters them all over the grass and tells Hellmerich that, as his first task, he has one hour to pick all the seeds up and place them back in the basket. She leaves him and Hellmerich laughs out loud at what he sees as a pointless task and goes off for a walk instead. When he comes back, the woman is very indignant that he did not even attempt the task. Next, she takes twelve golden keys and throws them into a pond giving Hellmerich his second task. He has one hour to get all of them back. Once again, she leaves him. And again, Hellmerich doesn't attempt the task and goes for a walk instead. He comes back in an hour and the woman is indignant with him once more.
She gives him one last chance to complete the challenge. For the final task, she takes Hellmerich into the castle and, after going up a big winding staircase, they come to a room with three veiled figures. She warns him to think carefully before he makes his decision and then leaves, giving him one hour to decide. Seeing this task as the most foolish one yet, Hellmerich hastily chooses the figure on the right that is revealed to be a huge fire breathing dragon, while the left was another and the middle was the Princess. 
The Sorcerer orders the dragon to take Hellmerich in its teeth and throw him out of the window, killing him for his failure.
Sometime later, the cabinet-maker and his wife have been waiting patiently for any news of Hellmerich's success. After a while, Hans decides to take up the challenge. His father and mother are unconvinced, but their son wants to prove himself. Hans leaves without any transportation or protection for his father had sold all he had for his elder brother. He takes the same path through the forest, thanking the birds for their beautiful singing, helping rebuild the anthill, picking a lovely bunch of pollen flowers for the bees to help with their hive, and sharing his breakfast with some ducks. He arrives at the castle and politely asks the woman if he can attempt the challenge. The woman asks him to come back at nine. And when he does for next morning, she gives him the task with the seeds. Hans attempts but doesn't seem to be going very far and after a quarter of an hour, he nearly gives up. Suddenly, a long line of ants appear and pick up every single seed, placing them back in the basket. Hans is very grateful and thanks them. The old woman returns and is very pleased at Hans' progress. She again drops the twelve keys into the pond, giving Hans one hour to retrieve them all. Hans is worried for he is not a strong swimmer. He attempts, but it seems hopeless. 
When all seems hopeless, the ducks he met in the forest retrieve each one of the keys for him, Hans is once again very grateful and thanks them.
The old woman returns and is very impressed. She takes Hans to the room with the three veiled figures to attempt the final task. The Sorcerer himself is there too. Hans is warned by her of the consequences if he chooses the wrong one and leaves him, giving him one hour to decide. Hans is still pondering over his decision when a swarm of bees fly through the window and buzz around the figure in the middle. After the old woman comes back, Hans tells her and the Sorcerer that the middle one is the Princess. The veils fall revealing that Hans had made the right choice. Hans gratefully thanks the bees for their help. With the spell broken, the Sorcerer and the two dragons die and the beautiful Princess takes Hans back to her palace to be her husband. Hans' parents are invited to the wedding and even though they have lost Hellmerich, they are very pleased for their son and give him their blessing, ashamed for thinking so little of him."

One day, she saw a little snake in the forest and said that even snakes had children; the little snake offered to be hers.  The woman and her husband raised the snake.  When it was grown, it wanted to marry, and not to another snake but to the king's daughter.  The father went to ask, and the king said that the snake should have her if he could turn all the fruit in the orchard into gold.  The snake told his father to gather up all the pits he could find and sow them in the orchard; when they sprang up, all the fruits were gold.
The king then demanded that the walls and paths of his palace be turned to precious stones; the snake had his father gathered up broken crockery and threw it at the walls and paths, which transformed them, making them glitter with the many coloured gems.
The king then demanded that the castle be turned to gold; the snake had his father rub the walls with a herb, which transformed them.
The king told his daughter, Grannonia, he had tried to put off this suitor but failed.  Grannonia said that she would obey him. The snake came in a car of gold, drawn by elephants; everyone else ran off in fright, but Grannonia stood her ground.  The snake took her into a room, where he shed his skin and became a handsome young man.  The king, fearing that his daughter was being eaten, looked through the keyhole, and seeing this, grabbed the skin and burned it.  The youth exclaimed that the king was a fool, turned into a dove, and flew off.
Grannonia set out in search of him.  She met a fox and traveled with him.  In the morning as the princess remarked on the wondrous sounds of the birdsongs, the fox told her the birdsong would be even better if she knew what the birds were saying:  that a prince had been cursed to take a snake's form for seven years, that near the end of the time, he had fallen in love with and married a princess, but that his snake skin had been burned, and he had struck his head while he fled, and was now in the care of doctors.  The fox then told her that the blood of the birds would cure him, and he caught them for her.  Then he told her that his blood was also needed; she persuaded him to go with her and killed him.
She went to her husband's father and promised to cure the prince if he would marry her; the king agreed and she cured him.  The prince refused because he had already pledged himself to another woman.  The princess, pleased, revealed that she was that woman and they married."

","A rich man's oldest two sons went out and saw the world for three years apiece, and came back.  The foolish youngest son also wanted to go, and his father finally let him, expecting never to see him again.  On the way, he saw men about to kill a dog, and asked them to give it to him instead; they did.  He acquired a cat and a snake by the same manner.  The snake brought him to the king of snakes, telling him how he would have to explain his absence, but then the king would want to reward the son.  He told him to ask for a watch, which, when he rubbed it, would give him whatever he wanted.
He went home.  Because he wore the same dirty clothing he set out in, his father flew into a rage.  A few days later, he used the watch to make a house and invite his father to a feast there.  Then he invited the king and the princess.  The king was impressed by the marvels the son conjured to entertain them, and married the princess to him.  Soon, because he was so foolish, his wife wearied of him.  She learned of the watch, stole it, and fled.
The son set out with the dog and cat.  They saw an island with a house where the princess had fled and conjured up the house to live.  The dog swam to it with the cat on its back; the cat stole it and carried it back in its mouth.  The dog asked it how far it was to land, and the cat finally answered; the watch fell from its mouth.  The cat caught a fish and freed it only when it promised to bring back the watch.  It did so, and they restored the watch to the son.  He wished the princess and her house and island to drown in the sea, and went back home."

Andrew Lang adapted a variant of it for The Orange Fairy Book. It is Aarne-Thompson type 403B, the black and the white bride, and includes an episode of type 480, the kind and the unkind girls.

","A man had a wife, and both of them had a daughter from an earlier marriage. One day, the man took his daughter to cut wood and found when he returned that he had left his axe. He told his wife to send her daughter for it, so it would not grow rusty. The stepmother said that his daughter was already wet and, besides, was a strong girl who could take a little wet and cold.
The girl found three doves perched on the axe, looking miserable. She told them to fly back home, where it would be warmer, but first gave them crumbs from her bread.  She took the axe and left.  Eating the crumbs made the birds feel much better, and they lay on her head an unfading wreath of roses, with tiny birds singing in it. The stepmother pulled it off, and the birds flew off and the roses withered.
The next day, the father went alone and left his axe again. The stepmother was delighted and sent her own daughter.  She found the doves and ordered them off as ""dirty creatures."" They cursed her to never be able to say anything except ""dirty creatures."" The stepmother beat her stepdaughter, and was all the angrier when the doves restored the wreath to its condition and the girl's head.
One day, a king's son saw her and took her off to marry her. The news of them made the stepmother and her daughter quite ill, but they recovered when the stepmother made a plan. She had a witch make a mask of her stepdaughter's face. Then she visited her, threw her into the water, and put her daughter in her place, before setting out to see if the same witch could give her something to cure the doves' curse on her daughter. Her husband was distraught by the change in her, but thought it stemmed from an illness. He thought he saw his bride in the water, but she vanished. After twice more seeing her, he was able to catch her. She turned into various animals, a hare, a fish, a bird, and a snake, but he cut off the snake's head, and the bride became a human again.
The stepmother returned with an ointment that would work only if the true bride had really been drowned; she put it on her daughter's tongue and found it did not work. The prince found them and said they deserved to die, but the stepdaughter had persuaded him to merely abandon them on a desert island."

David Thomson translated it as ""The Old Man Who Made the Dead Trees Blossom"" for Hasegawa Takejirō's Japanese Fairy Tale Series (1885). Andrew Lang included it as ""The Envious Neighbor"" in The Violet Fairy Book (1901), adapting it from a German text in Japanische Märchen compiled by David August Brauns (the original German title being Der neidische Nachbar).","An old childless couple loved their dog.  One day, it dug in the garden, and they found a box of gold coins there.  A neighbor thought the dog must have the ability to find treasure, and managed to borrow the dog.  When it dug in his garden, there were only bones, so he killed the dog in rage.  He told the couple that the dog had just dropped dead.  They grieved and buried it under the fig tree where they had found the treasure.  One night, the dog's master dreamed that the dog told him to chop down the tree and make a mortar from it.  He told his wife, who said they must do as the dog asked.  When they did, the rice put into the mortar turned into  gold.  The neighbor borrowed it, but the rice turned to foul-smelling berries, and he and his wife smashed and burned the mortar.
That night, in a dream, the dog told his master to take the ashes and sprinkle them on certain cherry trees.  When he did, the cherry trees came into bloom, and the daimyō (feudal landlord), passing by, marveled and gave him many gifts.  The neighbor tried to do the same, but the ashes blew into the daimyō's eyes, so he threw him into prison; when he was let out, his village would not let him live there anymore, and he could not, with his wicked ways, find a new home."

","A king with three daughters and a son married his daughters to the first men to pass before the castle at noon:  a swineherd, a huntsman, and a grave-digger.  His son did not go to the wedding, but walked in the garden, where he heard a voice saying that the man was happy who was kissed by the fair Fiorita.  He set out in search of her.
Three years later, he saw a palace with a fountain in front of it, and a child playing in the fountain.  He approached, and the child cried for his mother, who proved to be his oldest sister.  He was glad at her good fortune, stemming from the enchantments of a magician on her husband, as on his other brothers-in-law.  They told him to go toward the sunrise, which was the way both to his other two sisters and to Fiorita, and gave him hogs' bristles to throw to the ground if he were in great need.
He went toward the sunrise, and found his other two sisters.  The middle one gave him feathers, and the youngest a human bone and told him that an old woman could give him more directions about Fiorita.  The old woman lived across from the castle where Fiorita lived, and she came by the window.  He fell in love at once, but the old woman warned him that the king would marry her only to a man who found her in a hidden place, and many princes had already died, trying.
He commissioned a cymbal that he could hide in, and had the maker sell it to the king on the condition that he take it every three days to repair it.  The king bought it and gave it to Fiorita, who took it to her room.  At night, the prince called to her, until she and her maids of honor had searched, and she had concluded that she had imagined the repeated calls, and told them not to come again.  He emerged and begged a kiss from her.  She allowed it, and a rose formed.  She told him that the rose would let him find her first in her hiding place, then among a hundred maidens, but that her father would set other tasks afterwards, more terrible.
After he had found Fiorita, twice, the king put him in a room, filled with fruit, and commanded that he eat it all.  He threw down the hogs' bristles, and a great herd of swine appeared and ate it all.  The king then demanded birds that sang so sweetly that they would put the princess to sleep.  The prince threw down the feathers, and birds appeared that put not only the princess but the king to sleep.  The third time, the king demanded that they produce, on the next morning, a two-year-old child who could speak, or he would execute them both.  The prince threw down the bone, and the child sprung up.
The king gave his son-in-law his crown and held a great feast for their wedding, to which his sisters and their husbands, and the prince's father came. So the prince and Fiorita reigned over two kingdoms."

","The ruler of a vast empire has one eye that laughs and one eye that cries, and the reason is only known to him. His three sons, Florea, Costan, and Petru each ask his him on different occasions. Only the youngest, Petru, obtains the answer: the Emperor cries because he thinks that after he dies his son will not be able to protect their realm from enemies, and that only the water from the fountain of the Fairy of the Dawn will be able to make both his eyes laugh again.
Florea and Costan depart on the quest first, but, after escaping a vicious dragon on the bridge, never return home. Petru tries his luck, but is less successful that his brothers. His old nurse, back at the palace, advises him he should take the Emperor's old and trusty horse to cross the bridge. The horse is magical and can reach different speeds. With this fabulous steed, Prince Petru kills the dragon, crosses the bridge, and arrives in a desert.
His father's horse asks what speeds they should traverse: like the wind, the throught, the desire or a curse? Petru agrees they should apply different speeds so as to not to tire and to cross the desert as fast as possible. And so they do.

After crossing the desert, Petru and the horse reach a copper forest and traverse it. The flowers cry out to him to pick one of them, but the horse dissuades him because they are cursed and will summon the ""Welwa"", a chimeric monster of the wood. Petru decides to face the Welwa and picks up a flower. The monster appears to face the prince, and they engage in combat for days. Being locked up in fierce combat, both pant and gasp for breath, but Petru's horse encourages him to keep fighting. In the third day of battle, Petru casts the horse's bridle on the Welwa and the creatures turns into a horse. The animal thanks Petru for releasing him from a curse, and rubs his nose against Petru's mount (the horse's brother).
Petru and the horses cross through a wood made entirely of silver, the flowers begging him to be gathered, but Petru is warned by the first Welwa that gathering the flowers will draw the attention of a second Welwa, even stronger than the first. Despite the danger, Petru plucks the flowers and prepares to face the second Welwa. After three days, and a tiring battle, Petru cast a horse's bridle over the second Welwa, returning to normal.
Lastly, the group pass by a third wood, entirely made of gold, and the same warning of the others apply to this one: if any of the flowers are gathered, it will draw yet another Welwa to them."

","A king received word that his son, the prince, and a gentleman had argued over tennis until the other man struck the prince.  The prince, though armed, had not returned the attack but only cried.
The king was displeased with the prince's cowardice, but decreed that the young man would be brought to court for having attacked the heir to the throne, for which he was likely to die.  He let him go wherever he wished in the city, under guard, for the fourteen days before his case was heard.
The young man tried to get advice, but no one could advise him on how to escape, because he had struck the heir to the throne.  An old woman told him she could save him if he would marry her.  He rejected her offer, but on consideration, chased after her and agreed.  She had him swear before a priest to marry her and then told him what to say.
In court, the young man tells the king that the queen had, while he was away, taken the son of a quarryman and passed him off as her own son.  Then, after her death, the king had met a woman and married her in secret, leaving her tokens, but one day he went off to quell a rebellion and while he was gone, his bride vanished.  The young man could now tell him that his chamberlain, the bride's father, had recognized the tokens and vowed that the king would not have her until he was willing to own her as his queen.  The young man had been born to her in secret.  Now he had the tokens to show his true birth.
The king owned him as his son.  He told him how he had learned the truth and admitted he did not want to marry the old woman because she was old and his father had not chosen her for him.  The king insisted that he must keep his promise, and the wedding was held.  The prince tried to hunt and forget his old wife, but one day, in the night, he heard a noise and thought it was robbers.  It proved to be a young and beautiful woman, who told him that she was his wife and a princess.  A wicked fairy had cursed her to that form.  A wizard had managed to have the spell break if a prince agreed to marry her as she was before her fifteenth birthday; then, as her fifteenth birthday approached, the wizard had discovered him and told her what she needed to know to save him."

It is Aarne–Thompson type 432, the prince as bird. Other tales of this type include The Green Knight, The Blue Bird, and The Greenish Bird.

","A merchant asked his three daughters what they want him to bring them from the fair. The older two ask for dresses or shawls, but the youngest wants either the feather of Finist the Falcon or a red flower. In some variants, he went to the fair twice, able to bring back what her older sisters had asked for, but not hers, but she did not vary her request. In the third or first visit, he found the feather, or else found the flower and must promise that his daughter will marry Finist the Falcon for it. Whether the flower or the feather, the thing brought Finist the Falcon to her at night, and he wooed her. If she was given the flower, he gave her a feather that would magically aid her.
Her sisters discovered the visit; they might have spied, or she may have appeared in finer clothing, from use of the feathers, than they knew she had, or she may have appeared in church as a strange woman (like Cinderella at the ball) because of her rich clothing, and not hidden it quickly enough when she returned home. Once they became suspicious, they often listened and, hearing a man's voice, tried to persuade their father that their sister had a lover, but failed. However they discovered it, the sisters put knives in the window, so that he was injured. He said that she must search for him to find him, which would wear out three pairs of iron shoes, and three iron staves. He did not return. She sets out to find him.
She finds a hut with a witch (sometimes referred to as a Baba Yaga), who gives her a gift (such as a silver spinning wheel and a golden spindle), and sends her on to another witch. This witch gives her another gift (such as a silver dish and a golden egg), and sends her on to yet a third witch. This one gives her a third gift (such as a golden embroidery frame and a needle that sewed of itself), and sent her to the castle where Finist was to marry.
In some variants, she found someone trying to wash the blood from Finist's shirt and washed it herself. In all, she managed to trade the witches' gifts to the bride to let her stay a night with Finist. The princess either put a magical pin in his hair to keep him asleep or gave him a sleeping draught; the third night, either Finist is warned not to drink the draught, or the pin falls out. He woke and knew her.
In some variants, he asked the nobles whom he should marry: the woman who had sold him, or the woman who had bought him. They agreed the woman who bought him should have him.
In other variants, she went home to her father. When he and her sisters went to church, she dressed finely and went with Finist, and her sisters came back with stories of the prince and princess who came to church. The third time, her father saw the carriage stopped at his own door, and the daughter had to confess. She married Finist."
the_fire_fairy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fire-Fairy,The Fire-Fairy,"""The Fire-Fairy"" or ""The Dancing Fire Maid"" (Russian: Огневушка-поскакушка, tr. Ognevushka-poskakushka, lit. ""the hopping fire girl"") is a fairy tale short story written by Pavel Bazhov, based on the folklore of the Ural region of Siberia. It was first published in 1940 in the children's stories collection Morozko released by Sverdlovsk Publishing House. It was later included in The Malachite Casket collection. In this fairy tale, the characters meet the female creature from the Ural folklore called Poskakushka (lit. ""the jumping/hopping girl""), who can do the magical dance that reveals gold deposits. This is one of the most popular stories of the collection. It was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and by Eve Manning in the 1950s.
Pavel Bazhov indicated that all his stories can be divided into two groups based on tone: ""child-toned"" (e.g. ""Silver Hoof"") and ""adult-toned"" (e.g. ""The Stone Flower""). He called ""The Fire-Fairy"" a ""child-toned"" story. Such stories have simple plots, children are the main characters, and the mythical creatures help them, typically leading the story to a happy ending.

","A group of gold prospectors, including an old man Yefim (alternative translation: Grandpa Efim) and an 8-year-old boy Fedyunka, called ""Tyunka"" by his father, sit around a fire in the woods. A tiny girl suddenly jumps out of the fire.

... just like a doll, she was, but alive. Her hair was red, her sarafan blue, and she held a blue kerchief in her hand. She looked around them merrily and her teeth shone white. Then she put one hand on her hip, raised the blue kerchief with the other and began to dance.

She finishes her dance and disappears, while the prospectors look as if spellbound and almost forget the experience afterwards. The only person who clearly remember the maid is Fedyunka. He also hears the cry of an eagle-owl as if the bird is laughing at him. Yefim explains that the girl was the Fire-Fairy, a sign of gold: ""If the dancer shows herself, there's gold in that place"". Next morning the prospectors start digging in the area, but cannot seem to remember the exact place where the maid had danced. Fedyunka blames the owl, but no one believes him. Children at the factory give him a nickname ""Dancing Tyunka"" (Russian: Тюнька Поскакушка, tr. Tjunka Poskakushka). The only person who doesn't laugh at him is Yefim. They become close friends. One day they see the Fire-Fairy again, and again the eagle-owl scares her away. Fedyunka is convinced that the Fairy would have shown them the way to gold if the owl had not hooted.
In the winter Fedyunka's father leaves to work in the mine, and the boy stays with his evil step-mother. He decides to live with Yefim instead. On his way to the village he sees the Fire-Fairy again. He follows her and gets lost in the forest, but the maid dances around him, and the snow melts. The winter turns into summer, flowers bloom, birds start singing on a birch tree. The Fairy laughs at Fedyunka and gives him an old spade that leads him out of the forest. Next day Fedyunka and Yefim go back to the birch tree and find a lot of gold. They cannot keep the secret for long, and eventually the landlord takes hold of the place, but Fedyunka and Yefim live in wealth for many years."

The baron came and learned this, and took his daughter-in-law for a walk along the cliff.  She begged for her life, and he did not push her in, but he threw a golden ring into the sea and told her that she should never show him or his son her face again without the ring.  She went off and got work in a kitchen.  The baron came to dinner at that house, and she was preparing fish.  She found the ring in it.  The guests were so taken with the fish that they wanted to meet the cook, and she went with the ring.  The baron realised that he could not fight fate, and announced she was his son's true bride and took her back with him to his home, where she lived happily with her husband."

the_fisherman_and_his_wife,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fisherman_and_His_Wife,The Fisherman and His Wife,"""The Fisherman and His Wife"" (Low German: Von dem Fischer un syner Fru) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 (KHM 19). The tale is of Aarne–Thompson type 555, about dissatisfaction and greed. It may be classified as an anti-fairy tale.","There is a poor fisherman who lives with his wife in a hovel by the sea. One day the fisherman catches a fish, which claims to be a one that can grant wishes and begs to be set free. The fisherman kindly releases it. When his wife hears the story, she says he ought to have had the fish grant him a wish. She insists that he go back and ask the flounder to grant her wish for a nice house.
The fisherman reluctantly returns to the shore but is uneasy when he finds that the sea seems to become turbid, as it was so clear before. He makes up a rhyme to summon the flounder, and it grants the wife's wish. The fisherman is pleased with his new wealth, but the wife is not and demands more, and demands that her husband go back and wish that he be made a king. Reluctantly, he does and gets his wish. But again and again, his wife sends him back to ask for more and more. The fisherman knows this is wrong but there is no reasoning with his wife. He says they should not annoy the flounder, and be content with what they have been given, but his wife is not content. Each time, the flounder grants the wishes with the words: ""just go home again, she has it already"" or similar, but each time the sea grows rougher and rougher.
Eventually, the wife wishes to command the sun, moon, and heavens, and she sends her husband to the flounder with the wish ""I want to become equal to God"". Instead of granting this, the flounder just tells the fisherman to go home, stating that ""she is sitting in her old hovel again"". And with that, the sea becomes calm once more, and the fisherman and his wife are once more living in nothing but their old, dirty hovel."
the_fisherman_and_the_jinni,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fisherman_and_the_Jinni,The Fisherman and the Jinni,"""The Fisherman and the Jinni"" is the second top-level story told by Sheherazade in the One Thousand and One Nights.

","There is an old, poor fisherman who casts his net exactly four times a day. One day he goes to the shore and casts his net. First he catches a dead donkey, then a pitcher full of dirt, then shards of pottery and glass. On his fourth and final try, he calls upon the name of God and casts his net. When he pulls it up he finds a copper jar with a cap that had the seal of Solomon on it. The fisherman is overjoyed, since he could sell the jar for money. He is curious of what is inside the jar, and removes the cap with his knife. A plume of smoke comes out of the jar and condenses into an Ifrit (a more powerful, malevolent jinni). The fisherman is frightened, although initially the jinni does not notice him. The jinni thinks that Solomon has come to kill him. When the fisherman tells him that Solomon had been dead for many centuries, the Jinni is overjoyed and grants the fisherman a choice of the manner of his death.
The jinni explains that for the first hundred years of his imprisonment, he swore to enrich the person who frees him forever, but nobody freed him. For the second century of his imprisonment, he swore to grant his liberator great wealth, but nobody freed him. After another century, he swore to grant three wishes to the person who frees him, yet nobody did so. After four hundred years of imprisonment, the jinni became enraged and swore to grant the person who frees him a choice of deaths.
The fisherman pleads for his life, but the jinni does not concede. The fisherman decides to trick the jinni. He asks the jinni how he managed to fit into the bottle. The jinni, eager to show off, shrinks and places himself back into the bottle to demonstrate his abilities. The fisherman quickly puts the cap back on and threatens to throw it back to the sea. The jinni pleads with the fisherman, who begins to tell the story of ""The Wazir and the Sage Duban"" as an example of why the jinni should have spared him.

Duban is a wise sage who is summoned to King Yunan to cure the king of his terrible leprosy. Duban cures him by having him play polo with a club tipped with medicine. The king is very grateful until a vizier tells him that if Duban could cure him that easily, he could also kill him just as quick. The king remains skeptical and the two exchange some moral tales.
The king recounts the tale of king Sindbad who accidentally killed his own falcon that was attempting to save him from being poisoned by vipers while the vizier recounts the story of a vizier who carelessly goaded a prince into almost getting eaten by a  ghula during a hunting trip.
The stories are recited but eventually the king is won over to the vizier's side. The king tells Duban he will kill him and Duban says that after he is beheaded, the king must read from a special book to his head and he will hear the head speak. The king is amazed at this and Duban is prepared and executed as was chosen by the king. Duban is beheaded and the king licks his fingers and turns the pages of the book open to find nothing there. The book was poisoned and the king dies. The head tells him that had he been grateful to Duban then God would have spared him, but since he hadn't spared him, then God wouldn't spare the king either.After the story, the jinni pleads for mercy, and swears to help him in return for being released. The fisherman accepts the bargain, and releases the jinni. The jinni then leads the fisherman to a pond with many exotic fish, and the fisherman catches four. Before disappearing, the jinni tells the fisherman to give the fish to the Sultan. The fisherman does so and is rewarded with money for presenting the fishes. However, every time a fish is fried, a person will appear and question them, and the fish answer. When the fish are flipped in the pan, it will be charred. Awed by the sight, the Sultan asks the fisherman where he got the fish and goes to the pond to uncover their mystery. When he reaches his destination, the Sultan finds a young man who is half man and half stone.
The young man recounts his story, as the story of ""The Ensorcelled Prince"". 

The prince had been a famous monarch of his country and had married his cousin whom he loved. However, his cousin did not return his love, and each night would elope with a slave. She would drug the prince and leave the city gates to sleep with the slave. The prince found out about this by overhearing one of his slave girls talk about it and followed his wife out of the gate one night to find the slave and kill him. He struck the slave in the neck but only wounded him and left before finishing the job.His wife spent the next three years in mourning and built a tomb for her still living lover. The prince put up with this for a while but eventually had enough and yelled at her that the slave was never coming back. Realizing he was the one who did this the wife cursed the prince and all the inhabitants of the city. She turned the prince into half stone and the inhabitants into fishes and placed them in a giant pond.The Sultan hears this and then assists the Prince in his liberation and revenge. He kills the slave and then takes his place covered in bandages in the tomb. He speaks in a thick accent to the wife when she arrives. He tells her if she'd change back the prince and the inhabitants he would be cured and they could pursue their love once more. She does as he commands and when she comes to greet him, the king pulls out his sword and cuts her in two.
The king and the now-cured prince become close friends, and the fisherman who first found the fish is rewarded with his son being appointed the Sultan's treasurer, and the Sultan and the Prince marry the fisherman's two beautiful daughters."

","A king raised a flea until it was the size of a sheep.  Then he had it skinned and promised his daughter in marriage to whoever could guess what the skin came from.  An ogre guessed, and the king had to marry his daughter to him.  The ogre took her to his house, decorated by the bones of men he had eaten, and brought her back men's bodies to eat.  She wept by the window and told an old woman her plight. The old woman told her that she had seven marvelous half-giant’s sons who could help her.  The next day, the old woman and her sons came and carried her off.
The oldest son heard the ogre whenever he approached, and each of his brothers put up an obstacle:  one washed his hands and produced a sea of soapsuds, one transformed a piece of iron into a field of razors, one turned a little stick into a forest, and one turned a little bit of water into a river.  The last one turned a pebble into a tower where they could take refuge, but they were trapped there, and the ogre came with a ladder.  The youngest son shot the ogre's eye out and cut his head off.
The sons brought her to her father and were richly rewarded.  The princess was married to a suitable prince and lived happily ever after."

","A couple had three sons, and the youngest was a fool. One day, Czar declared that whoever made him a ship that could sail through the air would marry his daughter. The older two set out, with everything their parents could give them; then the youngest set out as well, despite their ridicule and being given less fine food. He met a little man and, when the man asked to share, he hesitated only because it was not fit. But when he opened it, the food had become fine.
The man told him how to strike a tree with an axe; then, he was not to look at it but fall to his knees. When he was lifted up, he would find the tree had been turned into a boat, and could fly it to the Tsar's palace, but he should give anyone who asked a lift. He obeyed.
On the way, he met and gave a lift to a man who was listening to everything in the world, a man who hopped on one leg so that he would not reach the end of the world in one bound, a man who could shoot a bird at a hundred miles, a man who needed a great basket of bread for his breakfast, a man whose thirst could not be sated by a lake, a man with a bundle of wood that would become soldiers, and a man with straw that would make everything cold.
At the Tsar's place, the Tsar did not want to marry the princess to a peasant. He decided to send him to the end of the world to get healing water, before the Tsar finished his dinner. But the man who could hear heard him and told the youngest son, who lamented his fate. The fleet-footed man went after it. He fell asleep by the spring, and the huntsman shot the tree he was leaning against to wake him up, and he brought back the water in time. The Tsar then ordered him to eat twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread, but the glutton ate them all. The Tsar then ordered him to drink forty casks of wine, with forty gallons each, but the thirsty man drank them all.
The Tsar said that the betrothal would be announced after the youngest son bathed, and went to have him stifled in the bath by heat. The straw cooled it, saving him.
The King demanded that he present him with an army on the spot, and with the wood, the youngest son had it and threatened to attack if the Tsar did not agree. The Tsar had him dressed in fine clothing, and the princess fell in love with him on sight. They were married, and even the glutton and the thirsty man had enough to eat and drink at the feast."

In this manner, the oldest son became a thief, the second an astronomer, the third a huntsman, the fourth a tailor. When they returned, their father put them to the test. He asked his second son how many eggs there were in a nest, high on the tree, and the second son used his telescope to tell him five. Next, the eldest son climbed the tree and stole the eggs without the birds even being aware, and the third son shot all five eggs with one shot. The fourth son sewed both the shattered eggs and the chicks inside them back together, so that when the eldest put the eggs back in the nest, again without the mother bird noticing, they hatched with the only sign being some red thread about their necks.
Not long after, the King's Daughter was kidnapped by a Dragon. The brothers set out to rescue her. The astronomer used his telescope to find her, and asked for a ship to reach where she was held captive. The huntsman at first did not dare shoot the dragon, for fear of harming the princess as well. The thief instead stole her away, and they all set out to return to the king. The dragon followed, and this time the huntsman killed him - but when the dragon fell into the ocean, the resulting wave swamped the boat and smashed it to pieces. Finally, the tailor saved them all by sewing the boat back together.
The king did not know which man to give his daughter to, because each one had played an essential part in the rescue. He instead gave them a quarter of the kingdom each, and they agreed that that was better than their quarreling."

Then, the sister struck, and the second son was also thrown out for reporting this. Following this, the youngest son was sent to watch; he claimed that their sister had gone to the outhouse and that the cows must have died from seeing the moon.

the_frog_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince,The Frog Prince,"""The Frog Prince; or, Iron Henry"" (German: Der Froschkönig oder der eiserne Heinrich, literally ""The Frog King or the Iron Henry"") is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in 1812 in Grimm's Fairy Tales (KHM 1). Traditionally, it is the first story in their folktale collection. The tale is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 440.

","In the tale, a spoiled princess reluctantly befriends the Frog Prince, whom she met after dropping a golden ball into a pond under a linden tree, and he retrieves it for her in exchange for her friendship. The Frog Prince, who is under a wicked fairy's spell, magically transforms back into a handsome prince.  In the original Grimm version of the story, the frog's spell was broken when the princess threw the frog against the wall, at which he transformed back into a prince, while in modern versions the transformation is triggered by the princess kissing the frog.In other early versions, it was sufficient for the frog to spend the night on the princess' pillow.The frog prince also has a loyal servant named Henry (or Harry) who had three iron bands affixed around his heart to prevent it from breaking in his sadness when his master got under a spell. When the frog prince reverts to his human form, Henry's overwhelming happiness causes all three bands to break, freeing his heart from its bonds."

Another tale of this type is Doll i' the Grass.Russian variants include the Frog Princess or Tsarevna Frog (Царевна Лягушка, Tsarevna Lyagushka) and also Vasilisa the Wise (Василиса Премудрая, Vasilisa Premudraya); Alexander Afanasyev collected variants in his Narodnye russkie skazki.

","The king (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a frog. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.
In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.

In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocrat and a wealthy merchant, respectively. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled young woman, who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying Koschei. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with Baba Yaga, whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a bird. The prince catches her, she turns into a lizard, and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the third sister, he catches her and no transformations can break her free again.
In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along."

Andrew Lang included the tale in The Orange Fairy Book with the title The Frog and the Lion Fairy.

","A king's capital was besieged, and he sent the queen to safety. She found it very dreary and resolved to return, despite her guards. She had a carriage made for herself, and took advantage of a distraction to escape, but the horses bolted past her power to control and she was thrown and injured.
A gigantic woman, wearing a lion skin, was there when the queen regained consciousness. The woman introduced herself as the Fairy Lioness.  She invited the queen to her home, a frightful cave peopled with ravens and owls, having a lake with monsters, but with little and poor food. There, she told the queen to build herself a house. The queen pleaded with her, and the fairy said that the only way to appease her was fly pasties, which the queen could not make. The queen lamented that the king would never know what became of her. She saw a raven eating a frog and rescued the frog. The frog told her that all the creatures in the lake were once human and had been turned to these forms for their wickedness, which seldom improved them. The frog also explained that she was a demi-fairy and her powers lay in her hood of roses, which she had laid aside when the raven caught her. She and her frog friends caught the flies for the queen, who made a fly pasty for the lion fairy. She then started to build a hut. She found it difficult and the frog sent her to rest and built it. The lion fairy wondered who helped her and demanded a bouquet of rare flowers; the frog asked a friendly bat to gather them. Then the frog told her future:  she would not escape, but have a beautiful daughter.  
The king discovered the wreckage of his wife's chariot and assumed she was dead.
The princess was born, and the queen persuaded the lion fairy, who would gladly have eaten her, to let her raise the child. One day when the child was six, the frog went to find the king. It took her seven years, in which time the lion fairy took the queen and princess hunting, which lessened her cruelty, because they were able to bring her quarry.  
The frog arrived in time to find the king remarrying, but the letter she carried convinced him that the queen was alive.  With a ring from the frog, the king set out to rescue her. In the forest, he saw the lion fairy, in the shape of a lioness, carrying the queen and princess on her back. The lion fairy imprisoned the queen and princess in a castle on the lake, and told all the monsters, who had fallen in love with the princess, that the king would take her from them.  
The king overcame the lion fairy, but she distracted him by pointing to the castle, and vanished. After three years, a dragon offered to rescue them if the king gave him a delicious food when he asked for it. The king agreed, and the dragon defeated the others. They found themselves in the king's capital. A prince fell in love with the princess and wooed her. He went to make arrangements for the wedding.

the_galoshes_of_fortune,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Galoshes_of_Fortune,The Galoshes of Fortune,"""The Galoshes of Fortune"" (Danish: Lykkens Kalosker) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a set of time-travelling boots, considered to be inspired by the folktale of the ""seven-league boots"" (syvmilestøvler).The tale was first published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 19 May 1838 with The True Soldier (one-act verse play) and ""That Was Done by the Zombie"" (poem) in Three Poetical Works.Reitzel paid Andersen 40 rixdollars for the story. In the tale, Andersen continues to perfect his colloquial style. Andersen read the tale aloud in the late 1830s with his novel Only a Fiddler. The tale irritated the young Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard with its satirical portrait of a bird that babbles on endlessly in a philosophical vein.","The story is set in Copenhagen. A group of guests are holding a large party. During the festivity Counciler of Justice Knap argues that the Middle Ages were a time better than their own, more specifically the time of King Hans. Suddenly two fairies arrive, dressed up as house maids. One is old, Dame Care, the other is a minion of Dame Fortune. The dame has brought a pair of galoshes along that can transport whoever wears them to whatever time, place or condition in life that he desires. And his every wish in regard to time and place will be instantly granted. Dame Care predicts that it will nevertheless make the person unhappy, wishing he was back in the present.
As the party concludes Councilor Knap decides to go home. He finds the galoshes, puts them on and is sent back to the reign of King Hans. He is not immediately aware of what happened, but does notice that the unpaved streets are full with filth and mud. He notices a procession for the Bishop of Seeland and assumes it's for the bishop from his time period. As he wants to cross the bridge to Palace Square he notices it's gone and ask two men in a boat where the bridge is and that he wants to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street. The men have no idea what he is talking about and Knap has trouble understanding their speech, which he assumes is an accent that belongs to people of Bornholm. As a result, he continues his walk, frustrated that not only the bridge is gone and all the lights are out, but that there are also no cabs to take. He decides to walk back to the East Street, but to his amazement the East Gate is now a meadow. Knap assumes he must be ill and desperately wants to go home, but he can't recognize any of the buildings. As he enters a tavern he tries to find his local paper, but they don't have it. When he notices a woodcut of a meteor over Cologne he wonders where the owners ""got this rare old print?"". As he discusses the content he gets into a conversation in Latin with a man who holds a bachelor in theology. They discuss many topics and Knap keeps misinterpreting these medieval topics for events that happened in his own lifetime. For instance, he confuses a remark about the Black Plague with a reference to a cholera epidemic in the 19th century. As the evening continues they all begin to drink more and Knap is repulsed by the vulgar behaviour of the people. He decides to sneak out, but the others pull him back from under the table by his feet, thereby pulling off the galoshes and breaking the spell. Waking up in his own age Knapp assumes it was all a dream and now fancies his own time period as the best.
Next, a watchman tries the galoshes on. He wishes to be the lieutenant, because he assumes his life is much better than his. The galoshes do their work and suddenly the watchmen becomes the lieutenant, sitting at his desk. He notices the lieutenant had written a poem called, ""If Only I Were Rich"", which confesses that the lieutenant actually feels he is short on money and is lonely as a result. Then he realizes he would rather be a watchman, because he at least has a wife and children who share his joy and sorrows. The galoshes then transform him back into himself. The watchman, still unaware what has happened, watches a falling star. He wishes he could travel to the Moon and suddenly the galoshes send him there at the speed of light. There he meets several Moon men who all wonder whether Earth is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced.
As the galoshes remain in the hospital one of the young night interns tries them on. His task is to guard the hospital fence, but he wishes to get out for a while, wondering whether he ""could get his head through the fence and escape."" As soon as he thinks this his head is stuck and he's unable to pull it back. He struggles for a while, until he wishes he was free again, which is granted by the galoshes. The next day the intern attends a theatrical play called My Grandmother's Spectacles in Kannike Street. The spectacles in the play are able to let anyone who wears them read the future from people's faces. The internee wishes he had such a pair of glasses and soon enough he has them. As he witnesses into the spectators' on the front row's hearts he notices many bizarre views. He concludes he must have had too much blood rushing to his head and wishes he could take a Russian steam bath. Suddenly he is indeed there, but fully clothed and scaring off the other people in the room. He has enough sense to pull himself together and tell everybody it's part of a bet. He then returns home and the next day he has a blistered back.
Meanwhile, the watchman picks up the galoshes at the hospital and turns them in at the police station where they are accidentally given to a clerk whose galoshes happened to have been lost too. During a walk the clerk meets a friend who is a poet and desires to live his life, for it seems to be much more enjoyable than his. At first the clerk enjoys being a poet full of inspiration. Then he wishes he was a lark, but is caught by a little boy and sold off to a family, where he is put inside a cage. He talks with a canary and parrot, who both lament the days when they were still free. As it so happens the cage door is open and the clerk tries to fly away, but is attacked by a cat. He manages to fly back to his own home, where the spell is broken again.
Then the fairy tale concludes with the clerk's neighbour, a theological student, asking for the galoshes. The clerk gives them to him. As the student walks away he wishes he could travel to Switzerland and Italy, whereupon he is on top of the Mont Blanc. In the freezing weather he wishes he was on the other side of the Alps, where he ends up in Italy, near Lake Thrasymene. There he enjoys the beautiful landscapes, but he is confronted with the local people's hunger and poverty. He concludes that it would be better off if his body could rest, while the spirit flies on without it. The galoshes grant his wish and he is now peacefully dead. Andersen concludes with a quote by Solon: ""Call no man happy until he rests in his grave."" Dame Care then tells the other fairy that her predictions have indeed all came true. Though she does grant the student a favor. She takes off his galoshes and takes them back with her, causing him to be brought back to life."

George MacDonald retold it as ""The Giant's Heart"" in Adela Cathcart. A version of the tale also appears in A Book of Giants by Ruth Manning-Sanders.","A king had seven sons, and when the other six went off to find brides, he kept the youngest with him because he could not bear to be parted from them all.  They were supposed to bring back a bride for him, as well, but they found a king with six daughters and wooed them, forgetting their brother.  But when they returned, they passed too close to a giant's castle, and he turned them all, both princes and princesses, to stone in a fit of rage.
When they did not return, the king, their father, tried to prevent the youngest brother from following, but he went.  On the way, he gave food to a starving raven, helped a salmon back into the river, and gave a starving wolf his horse to eat.  The wolf let the prince ride on him, instead, and showed him the giant's castle, telling him to go inside. The prince was reluctant fearing the wrath of the giant, but the wolf persuaded the prince to enter the castle, for there he would encounter not the giant, but the princess the giant kept prisoner.
The princess was very beautiful, and the prince wanted to know how he could kill the giant and set her and his family free. The princess said that there was no way, as the giant did not keep his heart in his body and therefore could not be killed. When the giant returned, the princess hid the prince, and asked the giant where he kept his heart.  He told her that it was under the door sill.  The prince and princess dug there the next day and found no heart.  The princess strewed flowers over the door sill, and when the giant returned, told him that it was because his heart lay there.  The giant admitted it was not there and told her it was in the cupboard.  As before, the princess and the prince searched, to no avail; once again, the princess strewed garlands of flowers on the cupboard and told the giant it was because his heart was there.  Thereupon the giant revealed to her that, in fact, in a distant lake was an island, upon which there sat a church; within the church was a well where a duck swam; in the duck's nest was an egg; and in the egg was the giant's heart.
The prince rode to the lake, and the wolf jumped to the island.  The prince called upon the raven he had saved from starvation, and it brought him the keys to the church.  Once inside, he coaxed the duck to him, but it dropped the egg in the well first, and the prince called on the salmon to get him the egg.  The wolf told him to squeeze the egg, and when he did, the giant screamed.  The wolf told him to squeeze it again, and the giant promised anything if he would spare his life.  The prince told him to change his brothers and their brides back to life, and the giant did so.  Then the prince squeezed the egg into two and went home with the princess as his bride; accompanying him were his brothers and their brides, and the king rejoiced."

Andrew Lang included it in The Yellow Fairy Book.

","An orphan tended sheep for a lord.  One day, he found an injured giant, who promised to reward him, if he bound up his foot.  The herdboy did that, with his own shirt, and the giant took him to a giants' wedding, giving him a belt to make him invisible, and then underground, where he ate a good meal and stole a loaf of bread.  The next day, he tried to tear off a piece of bread to eat, but he could not, until he finally bit it.  It still did not break, but he found a gold piece dropped from his mouth.  He used the gold to buy food.  
The lord had a beautiful daughter who was always polite to the herdboy.  He decided to give her a bag of gold on her birthday, using the belt to leave it secretly.  It gave him so much pleasure that he did it for seven more nights.  The eighth night, the girl and her parents watched for who did it, and the herdboy forgot his belt and so was caught.  The lord sent him from his service.  The herdboy spent his gold on fine clothing and a coach with horses, and returned.  They were astounded, and when they heard of his good fortune, agreed that he should marry their daughter."

It was translated into German by Emmy Schreck as Die Gaben des Unholds. Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book (1903), listing his source as Finnische Mahrchen.

","A widower forbade his only son to shoot at some birds.  One day, he did so, and chased after a bird he wounded until he became lost in the forest.  When night fell, he saw a magician being chased by wolves.  He shot the largest wolf, which put all the rest to flight.  The magician gave him shelter during the night.  In the morning, he could not be woken.  The magician left to hunt.  The boy woke and talked with the maid servant, who told him to ask for the horse in the third stall as a reward.  When he did, the magician tried to persuade him otherwise, but finally gave it to him, along with a zither, a fiddle, and a flute, telling him to play each one in turn if he were in danger.
The horse warned him not to go back to his father, who would only beat him.  He rode the horse on, to the king's city, where everyone admired the horse.  The horse told him to tell the king to stable it with the royal horses; then they would grow as beautiful as it.  This worked, but made the old groom envious of the boy.  He told the king that the boy had claimed to be able to find the king's old war-charger, which had been lost in the woods.  The king ordered the boy to find it in three days.  The horse told him to demand a hundred dead oxen, cut to pieces, and they rode off.  At the horse's instructions, he bridled the third horse that came to them, and then distracted the magician's raven by throwing the meat behind them.  The groom claimed that he had said he could restore the king's vanished wife.  The horse told him to ride it to the river, where it would dive in and assume her true form; she was the queen.  This pleased the king, but the groom told him that the boy had threatened to take the throne, and the king sentenced him to be hanged.  The boy played the zither, and the hangman had to dance all day.  The next day, everyone came to see him hanged, the boy played the fiddle, and the whole crowd danced.  The third day, the king wanted to refuse to let him play the flute, but the crowd persuaded him.  The king insisted on being tied to a tree first, but he still danced, until his back was raw, and then the magician appeared.  He destroyed the gallows and killed the king.  The people chose the boy for their king, and the old groom drowned himself, because the boy might have been poor all his life without his interference."
the_gigantic_turnip,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gigantic_Turnip,The Gigantic Turnip,"""The Gigantic Turnip"" or ""The Enormous Turnip"" (Russian: Репка) is a Russian folktale.
The tale was collected by  Aleksandr Afanas'ev in his 1850s Narodnye Russkie skazki (tale number 89). The story has been rewritten and adapted numerous times, and translated into other languages (e.g. into Polish by Julian Tuwim; into Bulgarian by Ran Bosilek) .

","It is a progressive story, in which a grandfather plants a turnip, which grows so large that he cannot pull it up himself. He asks the grandmother for help, and they together still cannot pull it up. Successively more people are recruited to help, until they finally pull the turnip up together. The specific ordering and set of people and sometimes animals varies. However, in the original Russian version the order is quite fixed, it is the grandfather (dedka), the grandmother (babka), the granddaughter (vnuchka), the female-dog (zhuchka), the female-cat (koshka) and finally the female-mouse (myshka). The humour in the story is that only with the help of the weakest and smallest creature (the mouse) can the giant turnip (repka) be pulled up.  The moral of this story is that of collaboration, and that if we all work together, we can do anything.
The story is very popular in Russia as the names of the participants rhyme:
repka (turnip) – dedka (grandfather) – babka (grandmother);
vnuchka (granddaughter) – zhuchka (she-dog);
koshka (she-cat) – myshka (she-mouse)."

She took the big one, and when she ate and birds begged for some, she refused it.  She found a place at a house, watching by night over the body of the housewife's brother, which was under spells, but she fell asleep the first night and the mistress hit her such a blow that she died.
The second sister set out the same way and came to the same end.
The youngest also set out, but asked for the little one with her blessing, and shared it with the birds.  She got the same place as her sisters, but stayed awake.  In the night, the body propped itself up on its elbow and grinned; she threatened to beat it.  It propped itself up twice more, and the third time, she hit it with a stick.  The stick stuck to the body, and to her hand, and she had to follow it into the woods, where the nuts and sloes hit her as they went, but they got out of the woods and back to the house.  They gave her a peck of gold and a peck of silver, and a cordial, which she used to bring her sisters back to life."

After the stag won, it bounded up to him and carried him off in its antlers. It set him down before a wall of stone and pushed him against a door in it, which then opened.

The maiden told him her story: She was the daughter of a rich count, and after the death of her parents, she had been raised by her brother. One day, a traveler stayed the night and used magic to get to her in the night, to ask her to marry him. She found the use of magic repellent and rejected his proposal. In revenge the magician then turned her brother into the stag, imprisoned her in the glass chest (coffin), and enchanted all the lands around them.
The tailor and the maiden emerged from the enchanted hall and found that the stag had been transformed back into her brother. The wild boar he had killed had been the magician.  The tailor and the maiden then married."

Blamed for his wrongdoing, the gnome is forced to apologize, promising to show him how to rescue the king's daughters.

Figuratively illustrating for the notions of motherly love and childish disobedience, it recounts how a family of goats is ravaged by the Big Bad Wolf, allowed inside the secured home by the oldest, most ill-behaved and least prudent of the kids. The only one of the children to survive is the youngest and most obedient, who then helps his mother plan her revenge on the predator, leading to a dénouement in which the wolf is tricked, burned alive and stoned to death.
Popularized by the Romanian curriculum and included in primers, Creangă's tale has endured as one of the best-known works in local children's literature. ""The Goat and Her Three Kids"" has also been the topic of several music, theater and film adaptations, in both Romania and Moldova.

","The story opens with an introduction of its protagonists: the hardworking and widowed goat and her three kids, of whom the two older ones are misbehaved, while the youngest obeys his mother. On one day, the goat gathers all three around, telling them that she must leave on a quest for food, instructing them not to open the door unless they hear her singing, in characteristically soft voice, the refrain:

The conversation is overheard by the wolf, who spies on the goat's family. Although being a godfather to the kids (and therefore an in-law, cumătru, to the goat herself), the villain has his eye set on eating the goat's children. A while after the mother has left, the wolf sneaks in front of the door and starts singing her song to the three kids. The ruse succeeds in convincing the eldest two children, who rush in to open the door. They are stopped by the youngest, who notices that the song is performed in an unusually coarse voice.
Having heard this too, the Big Bad Wolf hurries over to a smith's shop, where he gets his tongue and teeth ""sharpened"". He then returns to the goat's house, and this time performs the song in a soft voice. The eldest kid ignores his youngest brother's advice for more caution, and rushes in to let the stranger in. Meanwhile, the other two hide around the house: the youngest by tunneling his way up the soot-filled chimney, the second-oldest by hiding under an overturned trough. As soon as he is in, the wolf decapitates the careless kid and eats him whole. This prompts the polite but imprudent kid hiding under the trough to speak up and wish him să-ţi fie de bine (roughly, ""may it serve you""). As a result of this, the intruder is able to drag him out of his hiding place and gulp him down. After spending some time looking for the third kid, the wolf tires and, in what is intended as a humiliating gesture, stains the walls with the kids' blood and places their heads on the window sills, modifying their facial expression to seem like they are smiling.
The wolf eventually leaves, and the youngest kid emerges from the chimney unharmed. Initially deceived by the heads smiling at her as she enters the courtyard, the goat learns what happened from the youngest kid, and begins to plot her revenge. She soon afterward begins cooking a rich meal, and filling a large pit near her house with embers and slow-burning firewood. She covers the spot with thin layers of mats and earth, and places a stool made out of wax on top of these. The goat then walks into the forest and meets her cumătru, informing him that she has discovered his evil deed, but that she has moved on. She also asks the wolf to attend a traditional memorial service for the kids, back at her house. The villain agrees, and unwittingly takes his seat on the wax chair, which melts as he consumes meal after meal. Eventually, he falls into the pit and is engulfed by the flames. As he slowly burns and pleads for rescue, the goat informs him that she follows ""the words of the scripture"", or lex talionis, which she paraphrases as ""a death for a death [and] a burn for a burn"". The story ends as the mother and child finish off their enemy with stoning, and all goats in the area celebrate the death with an actual feast."
the_goblin_and_the_grocer,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goblin_and_the_Grocer,The Goblin and the Grocer,"""The Goblin at the Grocer's"" (Danish: Nissen hos Spekhøkeren) is a fairy tale published 1852 by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about a goblin (nisse) who must choose between poetry or his Christmas porridge from a grocer.
Andrew Lang included the tale as ""The Goblin and the Grocer"" in The Pink Fairy Book (1897).
The spekhøkeren does not mean just ""grocer"" but a materialistic ""Philistine"" as well, and he uses pages ripped out of a precious book of poems to wrap merchandise such as cheese. Hence the alternate title ""The Goblin and the Huckster"".","Once, a student lived in an attic while a grocer lived on the first floor with a nisse, or house goblin.  Because the grocer treated the nisse for Christmas with a dish of porridge (Danish: fad grød) with a large lump of butter in the middle, the nisse was attached to the grocer. One day, the student came to buy cheese and candles; then he discovered that his cheese was wrapped in a page from a poetry book, so he bought the book instead of the cheese, and joked that the grocer knew nothing about poetry.  The goblin, offended by the joke, used magic to make everything in the room speak and they all agreed that poetry was useless.  The goblin went to tell the student, but he saw a beautiful, marvelous tree of light in the student's room, the most splendid thing he had ever seen.  He kept going back to watch the tree of light through the peephole, but could not stay there, for the grocer gave him jam and butter. One day when there was a fire, the red-capped nisse ran to save the poetry book, and realized that he thought the book the greatest treasure in the house.  Still, he decided to divide his time between the grocer and the student, because the student provided no Christmas porridge (Julegrød)."

","A fisherman caught a golden fish, who gave him and his wife a rich castle on the condition that he will not tell anyone how he had gotten it.  His wife badgered the knowledge from him, but he caught the fish again and regained the castle, and when she badgered the truth out of him again, he caught the fish a third time.  The fish saw it was fated to fall into the fisherman's hand and told him to take it home and cut it into six pieces, giving two to his wife and two to his horse. He had to bury the last two pieces in the ground.  When he did, his wife gave birth to twins of gold, the horse gave birth to two foals of gold, and two golden lilies sprouted from the earth.
When they were grown, the gold children left home, telling their father that the lilies would wither if they were ill and die if they were dead.  People mocked them because of their golden appearance, and one child went back to his father, but the other went on, through a forest filled with robbers.  He covered himself with bearskins to hide the gold from the thieves, and wooed a maiden. They fell in love and soon married.  Her father then came home and believed his son-in-law was a beggar because he was covered with bearskins. However, the next morning, he was relieved when he saw the gold skin of the young man who was no longer wearing the skins.
The gold man went out to hunt a stag and asked an old witch about it.  The witch told him that she knew of the stag, but her dog barked at him. When he threatened to shoot it, the witch transformed him into stone.  Back home, his brother saw that the lily had withered and realized his brother was in trouble. He went to help him, but did not approach the witch closely enough to be transformed. Then he threatened to shoot her if she did not restore his brother.  The witch did so, and one brother went back to his bride and the other returned to their father."
the_gold_bearded_man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold-bearded_Man,The Gold-bearded Man,"The Gold-bearded Man (Hungarian: Az aranszakállú embör) is a Hungarian fairy tale collected by Laszlo Arany. It was translated and published as Der goldbärtige Mann by Elisabeth Rona-Sklárek in Ungarische Volksmährchen. Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.

","A dying king asked of his queen that she would never remarry, but rather devote the rest of her life to caring for their only son.  She promised to do as he requested, but no sooner was her husband dead than she remarried and had her new husband made king instead of her son.  The stepfather was a wicked man and treated his stepson very cruelly.
By the castle, there was a brook that was of milk rather than water, which had plenty for everyone, but the new king forbade anyone to take the milk.  The guards noticed a gold-bearded man taking buckets of milk in the morning and then strangely vanishing.  The king came to see.  He wondered if he could ever capture such a man, and many attempts failed.  One day, an old soldier told him to leave bread, bacon, and drugged wine for the man; he would eat, drink, and fall asleep.  Then they could catch him.  The plan succeeded, and the king put the man in a cage.  After a month had passed, the king had to go to war.  He told his stepson to feed the man but not free him, or his fate would be terrible.
The prince accidentally shot an arrow into the cage, and the gold-bearded man refused to give it back unless he freed him.  After much pleading, the prince was convinced.  The gold-bearded man promised to repay him a thousand-fold and vanished.  The prince decided that running away could not be more dangerous than staying and left.  As he went along, he met a wood dove.  He was on the verge of shooting it when it implored him not to because its two children would starve.  He spared it, and the dove said that because of his act of mercy it would find a way to repay him.  The prince continued on, eventually meeting with a duck and then later a stork. Both times the same thing happened as had with the wood dove.
He met with two soldiers, and they traveled together in search of work.  A king hired the soldiers as coachmen and the prince as his companion.  The jealous soldiers told him the prince had claimed that if he were made the king's steward, he could ensure that no grain was lost from the king's store; if he set the prince to separate wheat and barley, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king had two enormous sacks mixed and ordered the prince to separate them.  The wood dove, who was the king of the wood doves, had his fellow doves sort them.  The king appointed him steward.
This made the soldiers more jealous.  They then told the king that the prince had claimed that were he in charge of the royal treasures, he would ensure that none were lost; if the king had a ring from the princess's finger thrown in the stream, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king did so, and the duck, who was the king of the ducks, had his ducks find it.  The king appointed him in charge of his treasures.
The soldiers now claimed that the prince had said he knew of a child who could speak every language and play every musical instrument.  The king thought this was magic, which he had tried to learn, and ordered the prince to produce the child, as a third task or be dragged to death.  The stork brought the child to him.  The king married him to his daughter, and asked how he had done it.  The prince told him, and the king had the soldiers driven away with whips."

W. F. Kirby included it in The Hero of Esthonia, and Andrew Lang, under the title The Water-lily. The Gold Spinners, in The Blue Fairy Book.","In a hut hidden deep in a forest, three beautiful maidens spend each waking moment weaving gold flax into yarn. A cruel older woman supervises them, collecting every finished thread. She leaves them only for short journeys - always leaving a full slate of work along with the warning to keep their eyes on their work, and to speak to no man; otherwise the gold will lose its shine and great misfortunes will follow.
During one of her absences, a Prince is separated from his hunting party, and wandering in the forest, comes across the hut. The elder maidens hide from him, but the youngest seeks out his company. Days later, when the King's search party finds the hut, the Prince and maiden sit before it lost in conversation. The Prince promises to return for the maiden, who sits to work her neglected wheel. Sure enough, the bright thread is dull now, just as the woman had predicted. Terrified, she is convinced that misfortunes will now come. Soon enough, the woman comes and with one glance at the tarnished thread knows everything. The youngest maiden manages to send a message to her Prince through a raven. The Prince comes to her and carries her off.
The woman is enraged and, as she is a wicked witch, promptly casts a spell. She conjures a magic ball, which flies by the maiden as she is held by the mounted Prince crossing a bridge.  Whirlwinds cast her from the Prince's arms and into the river. Though he tries to dive in after her, he is restrained by his men. A year later, visiting the spot, he sees a yellow water lily in the river and hears a voice sing a forlorn song about being bewitched and forsaken. He goes on through the forest to the hut and consults the gold-spinners, who insist that the flower must be their sister. He sleeps the night in the hut, having a magic cake for his dinner secretly prepared by the eldest sister. In the morning, as he rides off, he understands the language of the birds. In this way he learns that the Wizard of Finland can help him, and through the birds,  contacts him. The wizard, in the form of an eagle, instructs him to stand on the river bank, smeared with mud, and say ""From a man into a crab"". Once he becomes a crab, he is to swim to the flower, cut its roots, and rise with the lily to the surface. Drifting with the current, he is to ascend a large stone, say ""From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden"" and so save the maiden.
He does all of these things and the maiden is restored, more beautiful than ever and dressed in magnificent robes and jewels. Now, although to the Prince only hours had passed in fulfilling his mission, actually 10 days had gone by and the King and Queen were at church, weeping for their dead son. The Prince and maiden arrive and are married on the spot. In their happiness, the Prince forgets his promise to the Wizard, to free the two maidens. A crow berates them, how could they forget the sisters. Chagrined, the Prince rescues the pair. The eldest makes up a poisoned cake, which the witch eats on her return and dies. The Prince and his bride and her sisters live quite happily, recovering 50 wagonloads of the gold thread that had been hidden away by the witch."

It is related to the theme of the Calumniated Wife and is classified in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 707, ""The Three Golden Children"".

","In a kingdom, long ago, a woodcutter's three daughters work with sewing and stiching from morning till night, selling their work in the marketplace. One day, however, the padishah of the city bans lighting candles at night, for a period of three days and three nights. The sisters, trying to earn their living, continue their activies by candlelight and cover their house with a thick curtain.
On the third night, the padishah decides to check if his people are following the ban. He passes by the house of the three sisters, who are talking among themselves: the eldest wants to marry the royal cook to eat delicious dishes, and claims she can weave a large carpet for the padishah; the middle one the keeper of the royal wardrobe so she can wear fine clothes and claims can weave a large tent for the padishah, and the third sister to the padishah himself, for she promises to bear him twins with golden hair: the male with the symbol of a half-moon on the front, and the female with a bright star on the temples.
The padishah brings the first two sisters to prove their extraordinary claims to him, fail, and are sent back to their poor house. The youngest sister marries him. The two sister stop by the palace gates and bribe an old woman (""the devil's own daughter"") to interfere with the birth of their nephews.
The third sister gives birth to their wonder children with the astronomical birthmarks, ""that darkness was turned to light when they were by"". The old woman steals the babies, replace them for pups and casts the pair into a stream. They are washed away to another region. Meanwhile, an old man grazes with his she-goat, which returns milkless. The man notices and follows the she-goat, which leads him to the twins. The man takes them to his wife and adopts both as their children.
Years pass and the old couple dies. The girl spends her days at home while her brother goes hunting. One day, the boy, now a youth, meets the padishah on a hunt. The padishah feels a unexplained longing to embrace the boy as his son. He returns to the palace, growing ill with longing, and the old woman notices. She goes to the old couple's house and talks to the girl. The old woman convinces her to send her brother for the garden of the Queen of the Peris (Die Feekönigin or The Fairy Queen, in other translations) and find a branch.
The boy goes on the quest and meets the Mother of Devils, who advises him on how to get the branch. He finds the branch (a twig with little leaves, each leave with a little bird singing a song) and brings it home.
Seeing the boy's first success, the old woman returns and tells the girl of the Queen's magic mirror. He finds the Mother of Devils again and she tells him on how to enter the palace and get the mirror: he shall find two doors - open the closed one and shut the open one; he shall find a lion and a sheep - put the correct fodder in front of them; he shall find two furnaces - put out the burning one and heat up the furnace with ashes. The Boy follows the instructions, passes the garden and enters the palace. He steals the mirror, and a ""mighty voice"" alerts the Queen of the Peris. The Queen commands the furnaces, the animals and the doors to impede his escape, but since the boy has been kind to them, the objects and animals disobey their mistress.
The boy returns with the mirror. The old woman returns to the humble house and tells the girl to have the Queen of the Peris herself. The brother returns to the Mother of Devils, who tells him to cross a desert, pass by a large cypress wood with a tomb housing the petrified bodies of those who failed, go to her palace and shout at the top of his lungs for the Queen of the Peris. The boy follows her instructions, but the Queen of the Peris is victorious and petrifies the boy with her magic powers. However, the Queen takes pity on the boy, gets a saucer, fills with ""diamond water"" and sprinkles it on the boy, restoring him to life. The boy tells her he came to seek her, and she consents to return with him from ""the Country of the Peris"". The boy also convinces her to restore the petrified men in the tomb.
After his return, the boy marries the Queen of the Peris. She tells him the will find the padishah on his hunt and that he will invite the boy to his palace, but he should decline this invitation. It happens as she predicts. The next day, the Queen summons her Black lala and commands him to fetch her father's steed and give to her human husband, so that he can go to the palace and invite the padishah this time.
Meanwhile, the Queen of the Peris rescues her mother-in-law from her cruel punishment (being half-buried in the ground) and commands the house to be transformed into a palace. The padishah pays them a visit, sees the brother and the sister, the Queen of the Peris and his wife, and learns of the while truth."
the_golden_headed_fish,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden-Headed_Fish,The Golden-Headed Fish,"The Golden-Headed Fish (Le poisson à tête d'or) is an Armenian fairy tale. It was first collected by ethnologue and clergyman Karekin Servantsians (Garegin Sruandzteants'; Bishop Sirwantzdiants) in Hamov-Hotov (1884) with the title ԱԼԹՈՒՆ ԲԱՇ ԲԱԼԸՂ (""Alt'un Bash Balygh""). It was later translated to English by A. G. Seklemian, and also in French by scholar Frédéric Macler. Andrew Lang included it in The Olive Fairy Book.","A king was going blind.  A traveller said that if a golden-headed fish, found in the Great Sea, was brought to him within a hundred days, he would prepare an ointment from its blood to save the king's sight, but he had to leave in a hundred days.  The prince took men and fished for it.  He finally caught it, too late to bring it back.  He intended to bring it back to show his father what he had done, and decided not to, because the doctors would try to make the ointment and so kill the fish uselessly.
The king refused to believe he had tried, and ordered his execution.  Servants warned the queen who gave her son common clothing and gold and sent him off to a distant island with a warning to take no man in his service who wanted to be paid every month.  At the island, he bought a house and rejected many servants, who wanted to be paid by the month, and finally took on an Arab who wished to be paid every year.
On this island, a monster left half of it a wasteland, and whoever went to fight it fell asleep.  The Arab asked the governor what he would give for killing it, and the governor offered half the land and his daughter; the Arab asked instead that he share in whatever he gained.  The governor agreed.  The Arab killed the monster and told the prince to take the credit.  The governor gave him a ship at his request, and secretly filled it with jewels.
They sailed to a far country.  The Arab urged the prince to ask the king for his daughter.  The king warned the prince that she had been married one hundred and ninety times, and all the bridegrooms had not lived out twelve hours, but the Arab urged him to marry her anyway.  They were married, but at night, he saw men digging a grave for him.  Then a small black snake wiggled into the bridal chamber, but the Arab saw it and killed it.  After that, the princess lived happily with her new husband.
One day, he was summoned home with the news his father was dead.  He ruled there.  One day, the Arab told him he had been summoned home and must leave him.  The new king wished to reward him, because he had saved his life, but the Arab refused all, because he was the Golden-Headed Fish."
the_golden_ass,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass,The Golden Ass,"The Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which Augustine of Hippo referred to as The Golden Ass (Asinus aureus), is the only ancient Roman novel in Latin to survive in its entirety.The protagonist of the novel is Lucius. At the end of the novel, he is revealed to be from Madaurus, the hometown of Apuleius himself. The plot revolves around the protagonist's curiosity (curiositas) and insatiable desire to see and practice magic. While trying to perform a spell to transform into a bird, he is accidentally transformed into an ass. This leads to a long journey, literal and metaphorical, filled with inset tales. He finally finds salvation through the intervention of the goddess Isis, whose cult he joins.","The prologue establishes an audience and a speaker, who defines himself by location, education, occupation, and his kinship with the philosophers Plutarch and Sextus of Chaeronea. The narrator journeys to Thessaly on business. On the way, he runs into Aristomenes and an unnamed traveler. The unnamed traveler refuses to believe Aristomenes' story. The narrator insults the unnamed traveler and tells a short story about a sword swallower. He promises Aristomenes a free lunch if he will retell his tale. The narrator believes Aristomenes' tale and becomes more eager to learn about magic. The narrator arrives at Hypata, where he stays with Milo, a friend and miser, and his wife Pamphile. Photis, a serving girl in Milo's household, takes the narrator to the baths, after which the narrator goes to the marketplace. There, he buys some fish and runs into his old friend Pytheas, who is now a market official. Pytheas reveals the narrator's name as Lucius. Pytheas says that Lucius overpaid for the fish and humiliates the fish-monger by trampling on the fish. Lucius returns to Milo's house, hungry and empty-handed. Milo asks Lucius about his life, his friends, and his wanderings, which Lucius grows bored with. Lucius goes to sleep hungry.

The next morning, Lucius meets up with his aunt Byrrhena in the town, and she brings him home and warns him that Milo's wife is an evil witch who wants to kill Lucius. Lucius, however, is interested in becoming a witch himself. He then returns to Milo's house, where he makes love to Photis. The next day, Lucius goes to his aunt's home for dinner, and there meets Thelyphron, who relates his tale about how witches cut off his nose and ears. After the meal, Lucius drunkenly returns to Milo's house in the dark, where he encounters three robbers, whom he soon slays before retiring to bed.

The next morning, Lucius is abruptly awoken and arrested for the murder of the three men. He is taken to court where he is laughed at constantly and witnesses are brought against him. They are just about to announce his guilt when the widow demands to bring out the dead bodies; but when the three bodies of the murdered men are revealed, they turn out to be puffed-up wineskins. It turns out that it was a prank played by the town upon Lucius, to celebrate their annual Festival of Laughter. Later that day, Lucius and Photis watch Milo's wife perform her witchcraft and transform herself into a bird. Wishing to do the same, Lucius begs Photis to transform him, but she accidentally turns him into an ass, at which point Photis tells him that the only way for him to return to his human state is to eat a fresh rose. She puts him in the stable for the night and promises to bring him roses in the morning, but during the night Milo's house is raided by a band of thieves, who steal Lucius the ass, load him up with their plunder, and leave with him.

On a break in his journey with the bandits, Lucius the ass trots over to a garden to munch on what seem to be roses (but are actually poisonous rose-laurels) when he is beaten by the gardener and chased by dogs. The thieves reclaim him and he is forced to go along with them; they talk about how their leader Thrasileon has been killed while dressed as a bear. The thieves also kidnap a rich young woman, Charite, who is housed in a cave with Lucius the ass. Charite starts crying, so an elderly woman who is in league with the thieves begins to tell her the story of Cupid and Psyche.

Psyche is the most beautiful woman on earth, and Venus jealously arranges for Psyche's destruction, ordering her son Cupid to arrange for her to fall in love with a worthless wretch. An oracle tells Psyche's parents to expose her on a mountain peak, where she will become the bride of a powerful, monstrous being. Psyche is left on the mountain, and carried away by a gentle wind.

The elderly woman continues telling the story of Cupid and Psyche. Cupid, Venus's son, secretly protects Psyche; Cupid becomes Psyche's mysterious husband, who is invisible to her by day and only visits her at night. Psyche's jealous sisters arouse her curiosity and fear about her husband's identity; Psyche, against Cupid's commands, looks at him by lamplight which wakes Cupid; Cupid abandons Psyche, who wanders in search of him, and takes revenge on her wicked sisters.

The elderly woman finishes telling the story of Cupid and Psyche, as Psyche is forced to perform various tasks for Venus (including an errand to the underworld) with the help of Cupid and an assortment of friendly creatures, and is finally reunited with her husband. Then Jupiter transforms Psyche into a goddess. That is the end of the tale. Lucius the ass and Charite escape from the cave but they are caught by the thieves, and sentenced to death.

A man appears to the thieves and announces that he is the renowned thief Haemus the Thracian, who suggests that they should not kill the captives but sell them. Haemus later reveals himself secretly to Charite as her fiancé Tlepolemus, and gets all of the thieves drunk. When they are asleep he slays them all. Tlepolemus, Charite and Lucius the ass safely escape back to the town. Once there, the ass is entrusted to a horrid boy who torments him but the boy is later killed by a she-bear. Enraged, the boy's mother plans to kill the ass.

A man arrives at the mother's house and announces that Tlepolemus and Charite are dead, caused by the scheming of the evil Thrasillus who wants Charite to marry him. After hearing the news of their master's death, the slaves run away, taking the ass Lucius with them. The large group of travelling slaves is mistaken for a band of robbers and attacked by farmhands of a rich estate. Several other misfortunes befall the travelers until they reach a village. Lucius as the narrator often digresses from the plot in order to recount several scandal-filled stories that he learns of during his journey. Lucius is eventually sold to a Gallus priest of Cybele. He is entrusted with carrying the statue of Cybele on his back while he follows the group of priests on their rounds, who perform ecstatic rites in local farmsteads and estates for alms. While engaging in lewd activity with a local boy, the group of priests is discovered by a man in search of a stolen ass who mistakes Lucius' braying for that of his own animal. The priests flee to a new city where they are well received by one of its chief citizens. They are preparing to dine when his cook realizes that the meat that was to be served was stolen by a dog. The cook, at the suggestion of his wife, prepares to kill Lucius in order to serve his meat instead.

Lucius' untimely escape from the cook coincides with an attack by rabid dogs, and his wild behavior is attributed to their viral bites. The men barricade him in a room until it is decided that he is no longer infected. The band of Galli eventually pack up and leave.

The narrative is interrupted by The Tale of the Wife's Tub.

Soon after, the Galli are accosted by an armed troop who accuse them of stealing from their village temple, and are subsequently detained (with the treasures returned). Lucius is sold into labor, driving a baker's mill-wheel. Lucius, though bemoaning his labor as an ass, also realizes that this state has allowed him to hear many novel things with his long ass-ears.

The Tale of the Jealous Husband and The Tale of the Fuller's Wife mark a break in the narrative. The theme of the two intervening stories is adultery, and the text appropriately follows with the adultery of the baker's wife and the subsequent murder of the baker.

Lucius the ass is then auctioned off to a farmer. The Tale of the Oppressive Landlord is here told. The farmer duly assaults a legionary who makes advances on his ass, Lucius, but he is found out and jailed.

Lucius comes into the legionary's possession, and after lodging with a decurion, Lucius recounts the Tale of the Murderous Wife. He is then sold to two brothers, a confectioner and a cook, who treat him kindly. When they go out, Lucius secretly eats his fill of their food. At first a source of vexation, when the ass is discovered to be the one behind the disappearing food it is much laughed at and celebrated.

Again he is sold, and he is taught many amusing tricks. Rumor spreads, and great fame comes to the ass and his master. As it happens, a woman is so enamored with the sideshow ass that she bribes his keeper and takes Lucius the ass to her bed. Lucius is then scheduled to have sex in the arena with a multiple murderess before she is to be eaten by wild beasts; the Tale of the Jealous Wife tells her backstory.

After an enactment of the judgment of Paris, and a brief digression on philosophy and corruption, the time comes for Lucius to make his much-anticipated appearance. At the last moment he decides that copulating with such a wicked woman would be repugnant to him, and, moreover, the wild beasts would likely eat him along with her; and so he runs away to Cenchreae, eventually to nap on the beach.

Lucius wakes up in a panic during the first watch of the night. Considering Fate to be done tormenting him, he takes the opportunity to purify himself by seven consecutive immersions in the sea. He then offers a prayer to the Queen of Heaven, for his return to human form, citing all the various names the goddess is known by to people everywhere (Venus, Ceres, Diana, Proserpine, etc.). The Queen of Heaven appears in a vision to him and explains to him how he can be returned to human form by eating the crown of roses that will be held by one of her priests during a religious procession the following day. In return for his redemption, Lucius is expected to be initiated through the Navigium Isidis into Isis' priesthood, Isis being the Queen of Heaven's true name. Lucius follows her instructions and is returned to human form and, at length, initiated into her priesthood.

Lucius is then sent to his ancestral home, Rome, where he continues to worship Isis under the local name, Campensis. After a time, he is visited once more by the goddess, who speaks again of mysteries and holy rites which Lucius comes to understand as a command to be initiated into the mysteries of Isis. He does so.

Shortly afterwards, he receives a third vision. Though he is confused, the god appears to him and reassures him that he is much blessed and that he is to become once more initiated that he might supplicate in Rome as well.

The story concludes with the goddess, Isis, appearing to Lucius and declaring that Lucius shall rise to a prominent position in the legal profession and that he shall be appointed to the College of Pastophori (""shrine-bearer"", from Ancient Greek: παστοφόρος) that he might serve the mysteries of Osiris and Isis. Lucius is so happy that he goes about freely exposing his bald head."
the_maid_freed_from_the_gallows,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ball,The Maid Freed from the Gallows,"""The Maid Freed from the Gallows"" is one of many titles of a centuries-old folk song about a condemned maiden pleading for someone to buy her freedom from the executioner. In the collection of ballads compiled by Francis James Child in the late 19th century, it is indexed as Child Ballad number 95; 11 variants, some fragmentary, are indexed as 95A to 95K. The Roud Folk Song Index identifies it as number 144.
The ballad exists in a number of folkloric variants, from many different countries, and has been remade in a variety of formats. For example, it was recorded in 1939 as ""The Gallis Pole"" by folk singer Huddie ""Lead Belly"" Ledbetter, and in 1970 as ""Gallows Pole"", an arrangement of the Fred Gerlach version, by English rock band Led Zeppelin, on the album Led Zeppelin III.

","There are many versions, all of which recount a similar story. A maiden (a young unmarried woman) or man is about to be hanged (in many variants, for unknown reasons) pleads with the hangman, or judge, to wait for the arrival of someone who may bribe him. Typically, the first person (or people) to arrive, who may include the condemned person's parent or sibling, has brought nothing and often has come to see them hanged. The last person to arrive, often their true love, has brought the gold, silver, or some other valuable to save them. Although the traditional versions do not resolve the fate of the condemned one way or the other, it may be presumed that the bribe would succeed. Depending on the version, the condemned may curse all those who failed them.
The typical refrain is:

It has been suggested that the reference to ""gold"" may not mean actual gold for a bribe, but may instead stand for the symbolic restoration of condemned person's honor, perhaps by proving their innocence, honesty, or fidelity, or the maiden's virginity. Such an interpretation would explain why a number of the song's variations have the condemned person asking whether the visitors have brought gold or paid the fee. In at least one version the reply is: ""I haven't brought you gold / But I have paid your fee.""The song is also known as ""The Prickly Bush"", a title derived from the oft-used refrain lamenting the maiden's situation by likening it to being caught in a briery bush, which prickles her heart. In versions carrying this theme, the typical refrain may add:"
the_golden_bird,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Blackbird,The Golden Bird,"""The Golden Bird (German: Der goldene Vogel) is a fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 57) about the pursuit of a golden bird by a gardener's three sons.It is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as type ATU 550, ""Bird, Horse and Princess"", a folktale type that involves Supernatural Helper (Animal as Helper). Other tales of this type include The Bird 'Grip', The Greek Princess and the Young Gardener, Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf, How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon, and The Nunda, Eater of People.

","Every year, a king's apple tree is robbed of one golden apple during the night. He sets his gardener's sons to watch, and though the first two fall asleep, the youngest stays awake and sees that the thief is a golden bird. He tries to shoot it, but only knocks a feather off.

The feather is so valuable that the king decides he must have the bird. He sends his gardener's three sons, one after another, to capture the priceless golden bird. The sons each meet a talking fox, who gives them advice for their quest: to choose an old and shabby inn over a rich and pleasant one. The first two sons ignore the advice and, in the pleasant inn, abandon their quest.
The third son obeys the fox, so the fox advises him to take the bird in its wooden cage from the castle in which it lives, instead of putting it into the golden cage next to it, because this is a signal. But he disobeys, and the golden bird rouses the castle, resulting in his capture. He is sent after the golden horse as a condition for sparing his life. The fox advises him to use a dark gray leather saddle rather than a golden one which is a signal again, but he fails again by putting a golden saddle on a horse. He is sent after the princess from the golden castle. The fox advises him not to let her say farewell to her parents, but he disobeys, and the princess's father orders him to remove a hill for 8 days as the price of his life.
The fox removes it, and then, as they set out, he advises the prince how to keep all the things he has won since then. It then asks the prince to shoot it and cut off its head. When the prince refuses, it warns him against buying gallows' flesh and sitting on the edge of rivers.
He finds that his older brothers, who have been carousing and living sinfully in the meantime, are to be hanged (on the gallows) and buys their liberty. They find out what he has done. When he sits on a river's edge, they push him in. They take the things and the princess and bring them to their father. However the bird, the horse, and the princess all grieve for the youngest son. The fox rescues the prince. When he returns to his father's castle dressed in a beggar's cloak, the bird, the horse, and the princess all recognize him as the man who won them, and become cheerful again. His older brothers got punished for their good-less deeds, and he marries the princess.
Finally, the third son cuts off the fox's head and feet at the creature's request. The fox is revealed to be a man, the brother of the princess who had been enchanted by a witch after being lost for great many years."
the_golden_branch,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Branch,The Golden Branch,"The Golden Branch is a French literary fairy tale written by Madame d'Aulnoy. Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A cruel king had a hideous but good-hearted son.  The king wanted to arrange an alliance by marrying his son to a princess who was as ugly as he was.  The prince, being tired enough of seeing himself, did not want to marry her.  The king imprisoned him in a tower until he consented, and sent his ambassadors anyway.  The princess did not want to consent, but her father sent her off with the ambassadors.  
Meanwhile, the prince found a room with stained glass windows, that were depicting the adventures of a man like himself, and then the central figure became a tall and handsome young man, which no longer pleased him.  He went back, and found a book, which he found depicted the same scenes, coming to life.  In one, the people told him to find them their queen.  Finally, he tried to find the key and the cabinet as depicted in the windows and book.  He succeeded and found a man's hand, which horrified him, but a voice told him he could restore it to the man and directed him to go to the gallery and search where the light was brightest.  There he found a portrait, and behind it a hidden room where a lady lay sleeping, and lamenting the fate of her beloved in her sleep.  An eagle brought him a branch of a cherry tree, he touched the lady with it, and she came to.  She implored the eagle to remain, but it left.  He asked if he could restore her beloved, and she told him he could not, but asked if he wanted something for himself.  He asked her to make him look less ridiculous.  She turned him into a tall and handsome young man and transported him from the tower.
The guards, trying to cover his disappearance up, told the king he was ill.  This gave him hope that the prince was weakening.  The princess arrived, and she was still unwilling.  Then the guards reported that the prince had died.  The king locked the princess up in the tower.
She found a room with stained glass windows, depicting herself in some windows and a slim, charming young shepherdess in others, which she thinks uses her to make the contrast.  An old woman appeared and offered her a choice between goodness and virtue; she chose goodness.  She found the same cabinet and key as the prince, and the box with the hand.  She was told to give it to an eagle as soon as she saw him.  She did so, and he became a man.  He told her how a wicked enchanter had changed him to this form because they both loved the same fairy, and she preferred him.  He offered to make her beautiful, and she accepted.  He transformed her and transported her from the tower.
There, she met with the transformed prince, who was now a shepherd.  They fell in love.  The princess, unable to forget that she was not really a shepherdess, could not bring herself to marry a poor shepherd.  She decided to consult an enchanter.  She found at his house, twelve cats being tormented by mice just out of reach, and the mice being tormented by a piece of bacon just out of reach.  The enchanter appeared, and she tried to flee, but spiderwebs caught her.  He asked her to marry him and told her that the cats and mice were once princes and princesses in love, but they had offended him.  She still refused him. He turned her into a grasshopper.  She fled and, once outside, lamented the pride that had made her reluctant to marry a shepherd.  
The prince set out to find her, but was lured by a phantom into a castle where a hideous old fairy asked him to marry her.  When he refused, she set goblins on him.  He made such a good fight against them that she stopped them, showed him the phantom, and threatened to have her killed if he refused her.  He called on the fairy he had saved, and heard a voice telling him to stand firm and seek the Golden Branch.  He refused, and the fairy turned him into a cricket.  
The cricket and grasshopper met, discovered they could both speak, and explained to each other that they had been a prince and a princess.  Two mice, both speaking, arrived at their hiding place, and one knew the way to the Golden Branch.  They went and were restored.  The fairy and her beloved arrived and arranged for them to marry at once.  The princesses who had been mice asked for help, and the fairy could not refuse anything on this happy occasion. She transformed them all back, and gave the prince and princess the castle and garden of the Golden Branch to live in."

He took it home, and the crab told his wife, (who was cleaning the other fish) to let down her skirt, her feet were showing. That evening, the crab asked to be given dinner, and when they did, they found his plate was filled with gold. This happened every night.

One day, the crab told the fisherman's wife to tell the king that he (the crab) wanted to marry his (the king's) younger daughter. The king, guessing he was an enchanted prince, demanded that the crab build a wall in front of the castle, higher than the highest tower, and blooming with flowers, and then a garden with three fountains that played gold, diamonds, and brilliants. When this was done, the king agreed.

The crab sent the fisherman to fetch rich garments for himself and his bride, and had himself carried to the castle on a golden cushion. After the wedding, he told his bride that he was an enchanted prince, a crab by day and a man by night, though he could change himself into an eagle whenever he liked. They spent their nights together, and soon the princess had a son.

The king held another tournament, decreeing that if any of the knights pleased his daughter, that knight would be selected by her, and she would marry him and would leave the crab. The method of selection was to be a golden apple - thrown to the king's daughter by whichever knight she selected. The crab sent the princess to give orders for his golden armor and steed, and his golden apple, to be brought to him. He warned her that he would be the knight to throw her the golden apple, but she must not reveal that he is the crab. When she was not pleased with any of the princes, the king held a second tournament. The crab was certain that his wife would betray him this time, but went again. When he threw her the golden apple, her mother boxed her ears, demanding to know why even that knight did not please her, and the princess confessed it was the crab. The queen ran back to their rooms, saw the crab shell, and burned it. The princess wept bitterly, but her husband did not return.

An old man went to dip some bread in water when a dog stole it from him. He chased after the dog, and found a palace. Twelve eagles flew in and became young men. They toasted the health of some family member -- a father, a mother -- and the last toasted his wife but cursed the mother who burned his shell. The old man heard the princess was ill, and that the only thing that consoled her was hearing stories. He went to the castle to tell his, and the princess went with him to the palace. When her husband gave that toast, she ran to him. He asked if she would stay with him the three months until the enchantment was done. She agreed and sent back the old man to tell her parents. They were not pleased, but when the three months were done, the prince and princess went back home and were happy."

He likes to stroll around a fishpond near the castle. One day, when he goes for a stroll, he overhears conversation behind the bushes. He spies on three women cutting grass on the hot summer day, then stop for a bit to rest. All three maidens are beautiful and to his liking, but the third is the most beautiful. He listens to their conversation: the first comments that it was foretold that she shall have golden times with her future spouse, a widower; the second says it was foretold that she shall remain single and have an evil time. As for the third maiden, she says that is was foretold that she will marry the prince and that God shall give her twins: a boy with a golden sun on the breast and a girl with a golden moon.
Prince Yarboi becomes interested in fulfilling the maiden's prophecy and falls ill with longing for her, to the king and the queen's dismay. He tells his parents he wants to marry the maiden from the village, and his parents agree with his decision. He rides a carriage to the village, finds the maiden and takes her to the castle to marry. Some time later, a neighbouring king, offended at not being invited to Yarboi's wedding, attacks the kingdom, and prince Yarboi goes to war to defend the kingdom.
Meanwhile, his wife is left to the care of the queen, who is skilled in the black arts. After the wondrous twins are born, the queen takes the children and places them in wicker basket with some money and a letter, then casts the twins in the water. Yarboi's wife is told her children died in childbirth. The queen writes a vicious letter to her son, who replies that his wife shall be thrown in prison.
As for the children, near the river, a fisherman lives with his family. One night, he has a dream about a pale woman guiding him to go to an island in the middle river, and that great fortune awaits him there. He decides to follow the vision's instrcutions and goes to the island; he finds the wicker basket with the twins and decides to take them as his adopted children, raising them along with his own biological sons.
Six years pass; the twins excel at school, while one of the fisherman's sons ""was a bit of a dunce"", and complains to his mother. The fisherman's wife advises her son to insult the twins by saying they are foundling. Unaffected by the offenses, they thank the fisherman for rearing them and leave home. They venture into the wood and find a large sum of money. They go to town to hire a wagon to carry the money, and live off of it.
The twins buy a palace from a man with the money and live richly. They send an invitation to prince Yarboi to visit them, who feels a strange sensation telling him to visit them. However, his mother spikes Yarboi's wine and he falls asleep. The queen wears her son's garments and goes to the twins' palace. After the banquet, the male twin shows her around and they go a fishpond. The queen, passing herself off as Yarboi, convinces him to seek golden fishes in the Glass Mountain beyond the Crimson Sea - a dangerous journey that certainly will kill him.
The male twin decides to go to the Crimson Sea and meets a hermit in the way. The hermit warns him against continuing his journey, but he insists. The hermit then explains that the youth will reach the Glass Mountain, pass by a pear tree garden and not get any pear; an apple orchard and he must not get any tree and at last a fishpond with he golden fishes; he is to get a nearby earthen vessel and to get only the water. The youth follows the instructions, but ponders about getting only the water and no fish.
At any rate, the youth gets a bit of the water, returns home and pours it in his pond. The next day, a gleaming gold fish appears in the pond. The male twin invites monarchs and nobles to come see the golden fish. The queen, Yarboi's mother, gives her son a sleeping potion and goes in his place. She visits the male twin and, seeing that he is marvelling at the golden fish, suggests that he could seek a music tree in the same place.
The next day, the youth goes to the hermit near the Crimson Sea, who instructs him on how to get the music tree: he is to climb the Glass Mountain; climb down a white staircase into a garden, cut off a rod from the music tree and leave without looking behind. He returns home with the branch of the music tree and plants it in his garden. The next morning, a  tree sprouts in the garden and it begins to produce music for the fish to dance.
The youth then invites the monarchs and kings to marvel at the music produced by the ""wonder-working tree"". The queen dresses like Yarboi again and visits the twins; she compliments the fish and the tree, and suggests he seeks a golden bird in a golden cage for his garden. The next day, the youth goes to the hermit, who gives him instructions: pass the lake and the garden and enter a castle; go to a third chamber where the cage is; wait for the bird to fly around the place and alight at a table, then get him and use a feather to disenchant a pile of stones. The youth follows the instructions, but the bird escapes from his hands at the last minute and he becomes stone.
Back to his sister, she learns that her brother has not returned and goes to the Crimson Sea. She meets the hermit, who gives her the same exact instructions. The sister traps the bird in her hands, plucks from it a feather and disenchants the piles of stones near the cage back to human form: princes who were turned to stone after failing to secure the bird. She also disenchants her Brother, and both take the bird to the hermit. The hermit dissuades them for desiring enything else and begs for their help: they are to cut off his head. They reluctanly obey his wish and decapitate him, a little bird springing where the hermit stood.
The twins bring the bird and the cage with them and place it near the tree and the lake, then invite all monarchs and princes to marvel at the new item. Prince Yarboi finally goes to the twins' palace. During the banquet, a piece of the male twin's clothing falls apart, showing the golden sun on his chest. Prince Yarboi recognizes the birthmark and embraces the youth and his sister as his children. He then leads the noblemen and other guests back to his palace, to release his wife from prison and mete out a severe punishment on his mother.
Before an assembly of kings and princes, Yarboi orders them to write in a piece of paper the ideal punishment for someone who tried to separate a family and kill two children through trickery and magic. The old queen is executed and, after Yarboi dies, his son succeeds him."

Some time later, Parmetella notices that the golden-leaved tree has a golden root. She takes an axe to the root and finds a staircase leading underground. She descends on the hole where the tree trunk once stood and reaches a splendid palace. She wanders through the palace and marvels at its sights, until she sees a table with food and drink. A Moorish slave appears and asks her to be his wife. She consents, and he tells her that she must promise never to light a lamp during the night.

","A widowed queen sends her daughter to a faraway land to marry.  Accompanying the princess are her magical horse Falada, who can speak, and a waiting maid. The queen gives the princess a special charm that will protect her as long as she wears it.
The princess and her servant travel for a time, and eventually the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the maid simply says: ""If you want water, get it for yourself. I do not want to be your servant any longer."" So the princess has to fetch herself water from the nearby stream. She wails softly: ""What will become of me?"" The charm answers: ""Alas, alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two."" After a while, the princess gets thirsty again. So she asks her maid once more to get her some water. But again the evil servant says, ""I will not serve you any longer, no matter what you or your mother say."" The servant leaves the poor princess to drink from the river by her dainty little hands. When she bends to the water her charm falls out of her bosom and floats away.
The maid takes advantage of the princess's vulnerability. She orders the princess to change clothes with her and the horses as well. She threatens to kill the princess if she doesn't swear never to say a word about this reversal of roles to any living being. Sadly, the princess takes the oath. The maid servant then rides off on Falada, while the princess has to mount the maid's nag. At the palace, the maid poses as princess and the ""princess servant"" is ordered to guard the geese with a little boy called Conrad. The false bride orders Falada to be killed, as she fears he might talk. The real princess hears of this and begs the slaughterer to nail Falada's head above the doorway where she passes with her geese every morning.
The next morning the goose girl addresses Falada's head over the doorway: ""Falada, Falada, thou art dead, and all the joy in my life has fled"", and Falada answers "" Alas, Alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two."" On the goose meadow, Conrad watches the princess comb her beautiful hair and he becomes greedy to pluck one or two of her golden locks. But the goose girl sees this and says a charm: ""Blow wind, blow, I say, take Conrad's hat away. Do not let him come back today until my hair is combed today."" And so the wind takes his hat away, and he cannot return before the goose girl has finished brushing and plaiting her hair.
Conrad angrily goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with this girl any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time, and the next morning hides and watches. He finds everything as Conrad has told. That evening, he asks the princess to tell him her story. But she refuses to say anything because of her oath. The king suggests that she might tell everything to the iron stove. She agrees, climbs into the stove and tells her story while the king listens from outside.
As the king is convinced she has told the truth, he has the goose girl clad in royal clothes. He then tricks the false princess into ""choosing her own punishment"". While each choice is different in each version of the story, in the classic version, she tells the king that a false servant should be dragged through town naked in a barrel with internal spikes. As a result, she is punished that way until she dies.
After that, the prince and the true princess are married and reign over their kingdom for many years."

The youngest, Ferko, was so beautiful that his older brothers thought he would be preferred, so they ate his bread while he slept, and refused to share theirs until he let them put out his eyes and break his legs.  When they had blinded and crippled him, they left him.
Ferko crawled on and, in the heat of the day, rested under what he thought was a tree, but was a gallows.  Two crows talked together, and one told the other that the lake below them would heal any injury, and the dew on the hillside would restore eyesight.  As soon as evening came, he washed his face in the dew, and crawled down to the lake and was whole again.  He took a flask of the water and went on.  On the way, he met and healed an injured wolf, mouse, and queen bee.
Ferko found a kingdom and sought service with the king.  His two brothers worked for the same king and were afraid he would reveal their wickedness.  They accused him of being a wicked magician who had come to kidnap the king's daughter.  The king summoned Ferko, told him the accusation, and said he would execute him unless he performed three tasks, in which case he would be exiled.  His brothers suggested that he had to build a castle more beautiful than the king's.  The princess was distressed by the cruelty of their act.  Ferko despaired, but the bee came to him and heard his plight.  The bees built such a castle, of flowers.

For the next task, they suggested that the corn had been cut but not put in barns; let Ferko put all the corn in the kingdom into the barns during the night, not losing a stalk.  The mice gathered the corn for him.  For the third task, the brothers suggested that he drive all the wolves in the kingdom to the hill they were on.  At this, the princess burst into tears, and her father locked her in a tower.  The wolf gathered all his fellows and came to the hill, where the wolves tore the king, the wicked brothers, and all his court to pieces.
Ferko freed the princess and married her, and the wolves went peacefully back to the woods."
the_grateful_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grateful_Prince,The Grateful Prince,"The Grateful Prince (Estonian: Tänulik Kuninga poeg) is an Estonian fairy tale.This fairy tale has been included in various collections of literature, such as Friedrich Kreutzwald in Eestirahwa Ennemuistesed jutud, by W. F. Kirby in The Hero of Estonia, and by Andrew Lang in The Violet Fairy Book. The latter mentions his source as Ehstnische Märchen: the German translation of Kreutzwald's work, adapted by F. Löwe.

","A king is travelling through the forest, but quickly gets lost. While wandering, he meets an old man who offers to help guide him home in exchange for the first thing that comes out of the king's palace upon his arrival. Recalling that his faithful and beloved dog always greeted him first on his return, the king is displeased with the proposed deal. However, having no other other choices he accepts. Unexpectedly, when he reaches his palace, the first thing that comes out is his wife. Overjoyed, the king orders for a lavish celebration. Suddenly the king lets his son grow up in the peasant's house.
His foster parents get rewarded for their care of the king's son, and they are content. The prince, however learns about the deception and the fate of the girl for whom he had been exchanged. He became distraught at the knowledge that he would someday become king while she would suffer with the stranger. He develops an ingenious plan to save her.
One day, the young man leaves his home dressed in a sack and carrying a bag of peas. He then enters the same forest where his father was lost many years ago. For several hours he walks in circles, as if he was lost. Suddenly, a strange old man appears before him and begins to question where he is going. The prince replies that he is carrying the peas from his aunt's funeral and is going to deliver them to the watchers, a custom followed in the kingdom. The old man offers to give the wanderer a job and the prince agrees. Happy that the young man accepted his offer, he twirls and sings as he escorts the prince to his secret home. Because of this, the old man does not notice that the prince is dropping peas along the way.
The stranger leads the prince into a dark, deep cave. As they pass further into the depths, a pale light begins to glow above their heads. At last, the prince is able to make out a silent countryside filled with animals, where absolute stillness reigns. Suddenly, the prince hears a sound like a troupe of horses, but the old man says it was a kettle boiling. The prince then hears a noise that resembles the whirring of a saw-mill, which the man dismisses as his grandmother's snoring. The two continue through the strange country and reach a lonely house on a hill. Here the old man had the prince hide in a kennel because his grandmother could not stand new faces.  The prince did not enjoy it, but complied. After a few hours, he is finally beckoned in by the old man. At once, his anger at being placed in a kennel turns to joy as he catches sight of a beautiful brown-eyed maiden.
The girl carefully brings out food and sets it on a table in the room, seemingly unaware of the young stranger. The old man sits down and eats ravenously, telling the girl to give only scraps to the prince.  He tells the prince he may rest two days in the house, but on the third he will put him to work. When the prince opens his mouth to reply, the old man forbids him to speak.  The maiden shows him a room. Enchanted by her demureness and beauty, the prince guesses she is not the man's daughter, but the peasant girl exchanged for him. He retires to his room and plots his next move.
On the second day, he draws water and chops wood for her. He wanders around the farmstead and sees many animals, including a black cow, a white-faced calf and, alone in a stable, a white horse. On the third day, the stranger sends the prince to clean the horse's stall and to scythe enough grass for the horse to eat. The prince is satisfied with this easy task. The maiden, who knows the enormous appetite of the horse, whispers a suggestion that he weave a strong rope from the grass. He should then warn the horse that he will bind its mouth shut and plug it up (prevent it from defecating) if the animal eats too much. The young man does as she suggests, and the horse, hearing his words, stops eating and does not foul its stall.
Next, the old man sends the prince to milk a cow of all its milk. Again, the maiden secretly helps the newcomer by telling him to heat a pair of tongs and threaten to use them if the cow does not give all her milk. He loves cow milk. The prince obeys, and the cow provides all its milk. Because it's scared of being branded with the hot tongs.
Then the old man sends the prince to bring in all the hay from a haystack.  The maiden knows that this task cannot be accomplished even in a week, even with red hot tongs. She tells the prince to tie the horse to the haystack and count.  He does so, and when the horse asks why he is counting, the prince is to say he is counting packs of wolves in the forest. He does so and the terrified horse begins to run, quickly, hauling back the entire stack of hay.
The old man is angry at the prince's success, so he sends him on an even more difficult task. He tells him to bring the white-faced calf to the pasture. The calf is flighty and frightened, but the maiden advises the prince to tie himself to the calf with a silk thread to ensure it will not escape from him. The prince does so and returns with the calf.
Exhausted and furious, and sweaty to boot, the old man tells the prince that there is no more work to do. He tells the prince to sleep, and he tells him that he must offer him his hand when he wakes. The maiden tells the prince that the old man means to eat him, so the next morning the prince should offer the old man a red-hot shovel instead of his hand. The prince obeys her again, but the old man is cunning. He refuses to shake the shovel for he knows it is not the prince's hand.
The next morning, the old man tells the young prince that he is satisfied with his work and, to show his gratitude, he will marry him to his daughter. The prince is overjoyed and runs to find his princess. When he tells her of the old man's announcement, she is shocked that the old man has discovered her secret - that she is the one who has given the prince the secrets to succeed in his tasks. The girl directs the prince to cut off the head of white-faced calf and withdraw from it a red ball, shining and pulsing with light, and to bring the ball to her.  The prince does as she asks, and the two flee the house with the glowing ball to guide them. The prince finds that the peas he left behind him have sprouted and grown, creating a clear route back to the palace.
In the morning dew the old man wakes to find his house empty. He first thinks the young people were not eager to marry. After searching for them, he realizes that they have fled. He has three stalls of goblins in his barn, and he summons all the creatures from the first stall and sends them after the prince and the girl.  As he does so, the magic ball pulses in the girl's hands. She has it change her into a brook and the prince into a fish. The goblins later return to the old man and say they had found nothing but a brook with a fish in it.
The old man goes to the second stall in the barn and sends the goblins after the couple, instructing them to drink the brook and catch the fish. Before they can find the couple, however, the maiden turns herself into a rose bush and the prince into a rose. The goblins return to the old man and say there was nothing but a rose bush with one lone rose.
The old man goes to his third and largest stall to summon his mightiest goblins. The goblins are unleashed and run out to tear up the rose tree. Before they reached the couple, however, the maiden turns herself into a breeze and the prince into a fly. After the goblins depart, the girl laments that the old man will be able to identify her and the young man regardless of the forms they take.  She says they must each go to their own home, but the prince says they must stay together and marry. He pleads with her to change her mind, but she answers by rolling the ball into the peasant's cottage and then vanishing inside.
The prince returns to his castle, where he finds that his father, the king, has died. On his deathbed, the late monarch confessed to switching the maid and the prince to deceive the stranger.  The prince mourns his beloved father and publicly reveals to his new subjects all that had transpired. His people agree that the new king should marry the girl and make her his queen."

The man consents to his judgement, stating that he knows their father will not live long. He then tells the children to ""watch for the trail"" and dig along it. The man transforms into a giant serpent, and moves away leaving the trail behind.

Joseph Jacobs included it in More Celtic Fairy Tales.The tale is similar to Aarne-Thompson's type 550, ""the quest for the golden bird/firebird"", the Scottish How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon and the German The Golden Bird . Other fairy tales of this type include The Bird 'Grip', Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf, and The Nunda, Eater of People.

","A king with one daughter grew old and sick, but the doctors found that the best medicine for him were apples from his own orchard. One night, he saw a bird stealing them. He blamed the gardener for neglecting the orchard, and the gardener promised that his sons, the land's best archers, would stop the thieving bird. The first night the oldest son came to the garden, but fell asleep; the king saw him and the thieving bird again, and though he shouted, the boy did not wake quickly enough. The same thing happened with the second son. But on the third night, the youngest son stayed awake and shot off a feather, thus frightening the bird away.
The king admired the feather greatly and said his daughter would marry whomever brought him the bird. The gardener's oldest son set out to do it. When a fox came to beg some of his lunch, the son shot an arrow at him. There were two inns, one merry, and one quiet in which to stay and when the oldest son found the inns, he chose the merrier one, and never came out again. Soon after, the second son set out, and ended up the same.
Finally, the youngest set out. He shared his lunch with the fox and out of respect, the fox warned him against a merry inn with dancing, and to stay in a quiet inn. The youngest followed the fox's advice and stayed in the quiet inn. The next day, the fox told him the bird was at the castle of the King of Spain and carried him there. Then it said that he could go in and carry out the bird and its cage. He went in, but he saw three golden apples with the bird, and a golden cage.  He went to put the bird in the golden cage, and it awoke, and the boy was captured. The king gave him one chance to save his life: to steal the King of Morocco's bay filly.
The son came out, the fox carried him to that castle, and warned him to not let the horse touch anything except the ground. He went in and saw a golden saddle. When he put it on the filly, it squealed and again he was caught. The king told him he could have his life and the filly if he brought him Princess Golden Locks, the daughter of the Greek King.
The fox carried him to that castle and warned him how to answer when asked a favor. He found the princess and woke her, asking her to let him take her with her, and promising to free her from the King of Morocco. She asked to say goodbye to her father; he refused; she asked to kiss him instead, and the boy agreed, but that awoke the king. He said that if the boy removed a great heap of clay, enchanted so that for every shovel thrown away, two came back, he would believe that he could keep her from the king. The boy tried, but the heap grew larger. The fox told him to eat and rest.  He confessed to the king and princess his failure, and the princess hoped he did not fail. The king let him take her, though he lamented being alone, as the princess's brother was kept captive by a witch.
The fox carried them to the King of Morocco, and the boy asked to shake hands with the princess before he left. When the king agreed, he carried her off on the bay filly. Then he brought the bay filly to the King of Spain, leaving the princess with the fox, but when the king gave him the bird and the golden apples, he stroked the horse as a fine beast, and when he was done, he rode away with both the horse and the bird.
They rescued his brothers, who were begging, and the fox asked the boy to cut off his head and tail. The boy could not do it, but his oldest brother did it for him, and the fox became the prince, the princess's brother. He married the king's daughter, and the gardener's son married his sister."

Andrew Lang included a translation of Kristensen's version in The Olive Fairy Book (1907).This tale combines Aarne-Thompson type 510A with type 425N, the bird husband, and type 432, the prince as bird.

","A queen dying of cancer asked her husband to do whatever their daughter asked of him, and the king promised.  The widow of a count and her daughter did everything to make themselves the princess's favorites (in some variants persuading the princess to have them stay at the castle), and then the widow told her that they could not stay unless the king married her.  The princess implored the king to do it, and when his objections could not convince her, he married the woman.
As soon as she was her stepmother, the woman began to maltreat the princess.  The king, seeing this, sent the princess to a summer palace, or had one built for her.  He went there one day to bid her farewell because he was going on a long journey, to a great tournament.  She told him to greet her to the Green Knight.  At the tournament, he met no Green Knight, but on the way home, he came through a forest where he found a swineherd, and on asking whose pigs they were, was told they were the Green Knight's.  He went on and found the marvellous castle where the Green Knight, a handsome young man lived.  He gave him his daughter's greetings.  The Green Knight had never heard of her—in some variants, he says she must have been thinking of the green of the graveyard—but makes the king welcome and gives him a gift: either a green book or a casket with his portrait.
The king returned home.  In the variants with the book, the princess had not known why she had spoken of the Green Knight, and when she went through the pages of the book, he flew in as a bird and courted her; in the variants with the casket, she recognizes him as the man she dreamed of, and he comes to court her.  In all variants, he visits her secretly, to avoid her stepmother, but her stepmother learns of it.  In the bird variants, she puts a poisoned pair of scissors in the window; in the others, she puts a poisoned nail in the oar he used to row out.  In all, he was injured visiting the princess and stopped.
The princess, not knowing why, is told by a bird, or overhears two birds talking, of his illness, and that a snake with nine young snakes in her father's stables could cure him.  She got the snakes, went to the Green Knight's castle, and got a job in the kitchen.  There, she persuaded them to let her cook the soup for him.  For three days, she fed him a soup made from three of the young snakes, and he recovered.
In some variants, he went to the kitchen and recognized her; in others, she asked to marry him, and he refused because he had already promised to marry, and she cleaned herself up so that he recognized her.  In all, they marry."

","An old widow has a son named Jack, who is considered a fool. Jack sits by the ashes and plays cards with his pet, a collie-dog. When he is 21 years old, he leaves home to seek his fortune elsewhere. He goes to a place called ""Land of Enchantment"", where - the narrator describes - animals and birds can talk.
Feeling hungry at a certain point of the journey, Jack meets a speaking robin. He goes to a thackit cot by the roadside, eats some porridge and sleeps on a feather bed. The cot's owner, an old woman, advises him to let people talk to him first.
Jack leaves the cot and walks a bit more. He hears some bells - the sign of a village nearby. Jack goes to the village and enters an inn. He sees some men playing cards with another one dressed all in green. Jack plays with the gentleman in green and wins. The gentleman in green says his name is Green Man of Knowledge, who lives in a place ""east o' the moon and west o' the stars"".

Jack reaches the house of another old woman, who gives him a piece of knitting for him to sit on and a piece of advice to always look forward, never looking behind him. Jack uses the piece of knitting and flies to the house of a third old woman. The third old woman greets him and tells Jack is approaching the Green Man of Knowledge's castle. She also gives him some advice: there is a bridge that leads to the castle, but it turns into a spider's web (a trap). The only way to get across is by traversing the river with the help of the Green Man's youngest daughter, the most powerful of his three daughters; they come to bathe in a river that runs under the bridge, the two elder become black birds, the youngest a white one; he should to steal the garments of the Green Man's youngest daughter to force her to help him get across to Green Man's castle.

The next day, the Green Man orders Jack to perform three tasks: first, to retrieve the Green Man's wife's golden ring, which fell in a dry well. For the first task, the Green Man's youngest daughter helps Jack by turning herself into a ladder to reach the bottom of the well, but Jack cannot miss one step, lest the girl breaks a bone of her body. Jack climbs down the ladder, he misses one step, but gets the ring and presents it to the Green Man. That same night, the Green Man's youngest daughter goes to Jack's room to reveal that, luckily for them, only a her pinkie finger was broken, but she had to wear gloves during dinnertime to avoid casting any suspicion on them.
The next day, Jack is tasked with building a new castle for the Green Man. Once again, his youngest daughter helps Jack. Lastly, Jack's task is to clear a wood of ants. Jack accomplishes the tasks with the help of the Green Man's daughter. Finally, the Green Man's daughter convinces Jack to run away from her father, and advises him to choose a lame mule (which is herself, under a new form).
Jack rides the lame mule away from the Green Man's castle as the creature pursues the pair. The Green Man's daughter asks Jack to look into her ear for anything they can use to hinder the pursuit. First, he finds a drop of water, which Jack throws behind them to create a lake; second, he finds a small stone, which he throws behind to create hills and mountains; lastly, he throws behind a spark of fire to create a conflagration behind them that consumes the Green Man.
The Green Man's daughter and Jack leave the Land of Enchantment and prepare to go to his village. For her help in destroying her father, she tells him she will return to him in a year and a day, but warns him not to let him be kissed by anyone, lest he forgets about her and their adventure.
However, as soon as Jack goes home, his collie dog licks his face, and he forgets about the Green Man's daughter. Jack uses the fortune he gained from the Green Man to become rich and buy himself a large place. He sets his sights on a miller's daughter as a bride for him. On the eve of his wedding, he sees a maiden in tatters and hires her as a servant. The maiden cooks and cleans.

the_green_serpent,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Serpent,The Green Serpent,"Le Serpentin Vert (translated as Green Serpent or Green Dragon) is a French fairy tale written by Marie Catherine d'Aulnoy, popular in its day and representative of European folklore, that was published in her book New Tales, or Fairies in Fashion (Contes Nouveaux ou Les Fées à la Mode), in 1698. The serpent is representative of a European dragon. His description is:  ""he has green wings, a many-coloured body, ivory jaws, fiery eyes, and long, bristling hair.""
The Green Dragon is really a handsome king placed under a spell for seven years by Magotine, a wicked fairy. In many ways the tale is based on the story of Eros and Psyche, to which the narration pays conscious homage when referring to the ""discovery"" of the Green Dragon.

","This story begins with a celebration feast for two twin princesses, who would later be named Laidronette and Bellotte. The King and Queen invite many fairies but forgot to invite Magotine, the older sister of Carabosse. Magotine was the oldest and most wicked fairy that existed. When she found out about the party, she was so furious for not being invited that she placed a spell on Laidronette that turns her into the ugliest woman in the world. The other fairies intercede and persuade Magotine to stop before she has cast a similar spell on Bellotte.

Years pass by. Laidronette grows up intelligent but lonely. She asks to live in a tower so that she does not have to see anyone. However one day she roams outside, and the Green Serpent sees her and begins to take an interest in her. She is terrified of the Green Serpent at first sight and flees from him, and accidentally gets swept out to sea. The Green Serpent appears swimming alongside her boat, but she refuses his help. She nearly dies in the ocean.

When Laidronette gains consciousness she finds she has been saved and taken to be the guest of an unknown king in a far away kingdom. The Green Serpent's identity as the spell-bound king is revealed to the readers. However, Laidronnette is not taken to see the king and does not learn this secret. All she knows is that an unseen king is taking very good care of her. Then the serpent starts talking to her at night, and is such a good companion over the years she falls in love with his conversation, sight unseen, and they get married.

The Green Serpent king convinces his wife to wait until the end of the seven-year period, to see what he looks like, or else his wicked enchantment in the form of a dragon will start all over again. Laidronette compares her own marriage with that of Eros and Psyche in Greek mythology, and tries to resist being ""like Psyche"" by waiting patiently for seven years. However, like Psyche, she is convinced by her family to take one look at her husband. When Laidronette discovers he is the same Green Serpent she once was so afraid of, war breaks out in the kingdom, and Magotine ruins the kingdom. The Green Serpent is sent into Hades while Laidronette is taken to become Magotine's prisoner and servant.

The serpent sends a good fairy to assist Laidronette in very difficult trials that Magotine thinks up: to spin cobwebs into hair and the hair into fishnets, to climb a mountain wearing iron shoes and a millstone around the neck, to fill a pitcher full of holes.[1] In one of Laidronette's errands as a servant, she finds the ""waters of discernment"" and when she drinks it, she becomes wiser, when she splashes it on her face, her ugliness vanishes and she regains her natural beauty.

The good fairy then sends Laidronette into an enchanted forest to hide for several years. Finally however when a period of time or imprisonment for the Green Serpent has come to an end, Laidronette returns to Magotine and Magotine tells her to go into Hades and get her the ""water of life."" Laidronette goes.

The personification of ""Love"" comes to assist Laidronette in going down into Hades and speaking to Proserpina, reminding her that is where her husband is held captive. Once she goes into Hades, ""Love"" restores the dragon back to his original human form. After Laidronette and her husband are united in Hades, ""Love"" brings the couple back to Magotine, and forces Magotine to break her spells, and then sends the couple back to Laidronette's homeland. In the end, a moral is given: Love is said to be stronger than Magotine."

The opening also features in Jesper Who Herded the Hares.

","A king's daughter was ill, and it was foretold she would be made well by eating an apple. The king declared that whoever brought the apple to cure her would marry her.  A peasant with three sons sent the oldest, Uele, with a basket of apples.  He met a little iron man who asked him what was in the basket and said ""Frogs' legs.""  The man said that so it was, and when he reached the king, it did contain frogs' legs.  The king drove him out.  The peasant sent his second son, Seame, who answered ""Hogs' bristles"", made the same discovery and received the same reception.
The youngest son, Hans, who was rather a fool, begged to go too, until his father let him.  When he met the iron man, he said the basket contained the apples which the princess would eat to make herself well.  The iron man said that it was so.  The basket held apples when he reached the castle, and the princess was cured.
The king, however, refused to let them marry until he had a boat that traveled over dry land and sea.  Hans went home and told his father.  His father sent Uele to the forest to make such a ship; the iron man came to him and asked what he was making; when Uele said ""Wooden bowls"" that was what he made.  Seame suffered the same fate, but when Hans told the iron man he was making a ship that would travel over land and sea, he made such a boat.
The king set Hans to watch a hundred hares in a meadow all day.  Hans did so, not losing any.  The king sent a maid to beg one from him, for guests.  Hans refused it, but said he would give one to the king's daughter.  Then the iron man gave him a whistle that would summon any hare back.  Hans gave the king's daughter a hare but then whistled it back.
The king sent Hans to fetch him a feather from the griffin's tail.  On the way, a lord of a castle asked him to ask the griffin where was the lost key to his money chest; another lord, how their ill daughter could be cured; a giant, why he had to carry people over a lake.  At the griffin's castle, he met the griffin's wife, who warned him that the griffin would eat him, but at night, he could pull out a feather, and then she would get the answers for him.
Hans did as she said, and when he pulled the feather, the griffin woke.  The wife told him that a man had been there and gone away, but told her some stories first.  She repeated them, and the griffin said that the key was in the wood house, under a log; that a toad had made a nest of the daughter's hair, but she would recover if they took the hair out; that the giant had only to put someone down in the middle of the lake and he would be free.  Hans left and told the other lords what he had learned; they gave him rich treasures.  When he reached the king, he claimed the griffin had given them.  The king set out to get some, but he was the first man to reach the giant, who put him down in the lake, where he drowned.  Hans married the princess and became king."
the_hairy_man,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hairy_Man,The Hairy Man,"The Hairy Man is a Russian fairy tale. Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.

","Two ricks of a king's rapeseed fields are burned every night. Finally, a shepherd with dogs keeps watch, and catches the ""Hairy Man"" who is responsible. The King puts him in a cage. The Hairy Man pleads with the King's son so earnestly that the young prince frees him. For this, the King orders that his son be taken to the forest and killed, and that his lungs and liver be brought back as proof. The man who takes him can not do it and kills an old sick dog instead.
The boy wanders the forest. Years later, he comes upon a cottage, where the Hairy Man lives. There he stays for seven years, working hard like a peasant, but never complaining until he is old enough to travel on. Before he leaves, the Hairy Man gives the boy a golden apple (which magically contains a golden staff and a golden-maned horse), a silver apple (which contains a silver staff and an army of hussars), and a copper apple (which contains a copper staff and an army of foot soldiers). The boy uses the first apple, and embarks on his journey, finally pledging his service to a distant king.
One day, the king (who only has a small army) is threatened by a very powerful king. The boy uses his second magic apple to provide reinforcements for his king. The king's youngest princess gives him a ring, and he carries it and half of a handkerchief his sister gave him into battle. The prince's men defeat the enemy so thoroughly that only two survivors are deliberately permitted to escape as messengers to the king who sent them. The prince falls in love with the youngest princess and he gives her the copper apple. The princess has already discovered who he really is after having his room searched, which turned up the half handkerchief. When the king learns that he is a prince as well as a brave and honorable hero, the king is more than happy to allow him to marry his youngest daughter."

Andrew Lang included it in The Yellow Fairy Book (1894) and Ruth Manning-Sanders included it in A Book of Dwarfs (1964).

","A childless couple prayed for a child, though he were no bigger than a hazel nut, and then they had such a son.  He never grew, but he was very clever.  When he was 15, he said he wanted to be a messenger.  His mother sent him to get a comb from his aunt.  He climbed on a horse that a man was riding by, and poked and pinched it until it galloped to the village.  There he got the comb, and took another horse the same way.  This convinced his mother. 
One day, his father left him in the fields with a horse while he went back home.  A robber tried to steal the horse.  The hazel-nut child jumped on the horse and pricked it until it ignored the robber and galloped home.  The robber was jailed.
When he was 20, the hazel-nut child left home, promising to return when he was rich.  He climbed on a stork as the storks were flying south.  In Africa, he amused the king until the king gave him a large diamond.  The hazel-nut child took it with him when the storks flew north again, and so he and his parents were rich thereafter."

After a time, the shark said if the monkey would only come home with him, he would give him a gift, and offered to carry him.  The monkey accepted, but half way there, the shark told him that the sultan of his country was deathly ill and needed a monkey's heart to cure him.  The monkey said it was a pity, because if he had known, he could have brought his heart, but as it was, he had left it behind.  The shark, deceived, brought him back to get it.  The monkey instantly jumped up into the tree and was not to be lured back down.  He told the shark a story of a washerman's donkey, which was twice persuaded to meet with a lion, and so lost its life the second time — and that the monkey was not a washerman's donkey."

","A poor woman finds a pot on the road. She thinks it must have a hole for it to be discarded, but optimistically decides she might find a use for it as a flowerpot. Looking inside she discovers it is full of gold pieces, and decides to drag it home in her shawl. She drags it for a while, but when she looks back, the pot has become a lump of silver. She decides this is better than gold, as it is less likely to be stolen, and goes on. After a time she turns back again, to find the silver has turned into a chunk of iron. She observes this will be easier to sell, and that the penny pieces it will bring would be safer than either gold or silver. She goes on again, and when she turns back a third time, the iron has become a rock. She exclaims how convenient this will be as a doorstop, and happily goes home.
When she reaches her home, the rock transforms again, revealing itself to be the Hedley Kow, a mischievous shapeshifting creature. The creature trots off laughing, leaving the woman staring after it. She proclaims that it was quite a thing to have seen the Hedley Kow for herself, and goes inside to think about her good luck."

It was adapted from ""das Pferd Gullfaxi und das Schwert Gunnfjödur"", a German translation by Josef Poestion in his Islandische Märchen (1884). Poestion acquired the Icelandic text from his contact, ""Prof. Steingrimr Thorsteinsson"".
This tale was the only one in Poestion's book that he did not derive from Jón Árnason's Íslenzkar Þjóðsögur og Æfintýri Vol. 2 (1862–64), and hence the only one not orally sourced. The Icelandic text ""Sagan af hestinum Gullfaxa og sverðinu Gunnfjöður"" was in the manuscript JS 287 4to, dated 1857-1870, now in the possession of the National and University Library of Iceland. The Icelandic text was eventually published in volume 4 (1956) of the full expanded edition of Jón Árnason's collection.There are a number of other Icelandic tale specimens in the collection that feature a horse or sword of similar names: Glófaxi og Gunnfjöður, Sagan af hestinum Gullskó og sverðinu Gullfjöður, Þorsteinn karlsson og hesturinn Gullskór, Hesturinn Gullskór og sverðið Dynfjöður. The variants give different names of protagonists, featured motifs, etc.
A retold version of it by Ruth Manning-Sanders under the title ""Sigurd, the King's Son"" is in her anthology, A Book of Ogres and Trolls (1972).

","There was once a king whose queen bore her one son named Sigurd (Icelandic: Sigurður), but she died when the prince was ten years of age.  The king grieved his loss for a long time, until one day at the queen's grave (or haugr, a burial mound) he struck friendship with a woman named Ingiborg (Ingibjörg), and some days later the king married her. Sigurd became very fond of his stepmother.
One evening Ingiborg spoke to Sigurd and advised him to accompany the king on his hunt the following day.  When Sigurd refused, Ingiborg predicted nothing good would come out of his refusal, and hid Sigurd under the bed during the king's absence.  In a while, a giantess (or Icelandic: tröllkona 'troll-woman' in the original) came to visit, addressing Ingiborg as her sister, pressing to know if Sigurd was home. Ingiborg entertained the giantess but persevered in denying Sigurd's presence. The process is repeated the following day, with another giantess asking for Sigurd, without success.  The giantess who arrived the third time too would leave empty-handed, so it seemed, but she cleverly managed to lay a spell, which she said would work on Sigurd if he were within earshot. The spell left him horribly disfigured, half scorched and half withered, with an irrepressible longing to seek out the giantess to gain peace of mind.

Defeating the three giantessesIngiborg took Sigurd from his hideout under the bed, and chastised his stubbornness, but prescribed a way to remedy the situation.
She gave him a ball (or ""clew"" hnoða) of string, and three gold rings.  If he let the ball of string roll, it would lead him to a giantess, and though she would threaten to make a meal of him in the pot and seize him with a boat-hook, he should bribe her with the gift of one of the rings. She would then offer to wrestle with him until his strength ran out and offer him a horn to drink out of, which he should accept since a draft of this will make him strong enough to overcome her.  He was to repeat the process with her two other giantess sisters. But should Ingiborg's dog appear before him with tears running down its snout, that was the sign that her life was in imminent danger, and he should return to help his stepmother.He followed her directions, finding all three giantesses in turn, the next giantess increasingly larger and more hideous.  Sigurd had to offer a larger ring as bribe at each turn, but he also grew more powerful with the drinking-horn offered by each of the giantesses.

Befriending Helga, the giant's daughterThe last giantess, after her defeat at the end of their bout, now steered Sigurd towards a fresh adventure, declared him ""stronger than ever you were"" (that is to say, no longer withered and restored to full health ""orðinn frískur aftur""), and wishing him luck. He was to go to a nearby lake, find a little girl (called Helga) playing with a boat, and befriend her with the gift of a little gold ring that the last giantess provided. Sigurd became the girl's playmate during the day, and when evening fell, persuaded Helga to take him to her home, past her initial objection, on account of her father being a ""fierce giant"".But as soon as they approached the door, Helga brandished her glove (glófi) over him, transforming him into a bundle of wool (or a ""hank, or coil"" of wool, ullar-hönk), which she tossed on her bed. Her father returned, searching every corner, and declared ""'This place smells of men. What's that you threw on the bed, Helga?"" (He begins his line with the Icelandic equivalent of ""Fee-fi-fo-fum.."" in the original text.) But Helga was able to explain it was just the wool that he smelled. The next day, Helga returned to the lake with the wool bundle and restored Sigurd back to shape with her glove, and they played at the lake during the day. On the third day, her father was going out into town, which meant they had the house to themselves the whole day, and since she was given custody of all the keys, they played games opening every room. But Sigurd noticed there was one key she did not use, and asked her about it. She blushed and did not answer. He tried to sway her to show him the unopened room, when he caught glimpse of an iron door, and sweet-talked her into opening it, which she agreed to do so only partially.
Wonderful horse and sword
Inside was a horse named Gullfaxi ""Golden Mane"" and a sword named Gunnfoder (Icelandic: Gunnfjödur) ""Battle-Plume"". The sword was richly ornamented, and had an inscription on its hilt that read ""He who rides this horse and wears this sword will find happiness"" (Icelandic: Hver sem á þessum hesti situr og með þessu sverði gyrðir sig mun gæfumaður verða).  Sigurd wanted to take a ride on the horse with all its trappings for one circuit, and Helga refused at first but eventually relented and revealed the name of the horse and sword. Much of the exchanged dialogue inserted here by Lang are his embellishments (e.g., ""'My father is a king, but he has not got any sword so beautiful as that. Why, the jewels in the scabbard are more splendid than the big ruby in his crown! Has it got a name? Some swords have, you know."") Helga gave him ""the stick and the stone and the twig"" that belonged as a set with the rest. Whoever is on the horse's back can throw the twig and have a great forest appear to hinder his pursuer. If the enemy is not foiled, then he can strike (or prick) the stone with the stick and a hailstorm will kill the foe.Helga finally relented under the condition Sigurd would only ride once around, but at the end of the circuit, Sigurd rode away.  Helga's father returned to discover the theft and ran after Sigurd riding away on Gullfaxi.  (Lang's tale calls the father a giant, but the original merely refers to him as a man or ""carl"".). Sigurd cast the twig to make a thickly wooded forest emerge, hoping to block his pursuer, but the giant retrieved an axe to cut it down, and was hot on his tail. So Sigurd hit (or poked) the stone causing the hailstorm killing the giant. Had Sigurd hit the stone without turning it over on the other side, he himself would have been struck and killed by the hail.
As Sigurd was riding towards his home, his stepmother's dog came running for him, and he hastened back to find nine man-servants (or þrælar 'thralls') ready to burn Ingiborg at the stake.  He struck out in anger and killed all of them with his sword (in the Icelandic original, the name Gunnfjöður is explicitly given here). Then he set his ailing father at ease, who had mistakenly held Ingiborg responsible for the murder of his son. Sigurd brought Helga home, and they had a great marriage feast.,"
the_horse_lurja,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_Lurja,The Horse Lurja,"The Horse Lurja (Georgian: ლურჯასი; transliteration: Lurdzhasi) is a Georgian folktale about the friendship between a princess and a magic horse, which sacrifices itself for her after it rescues her from great peril. Although the tale appears in Georgia, some scholars recognize similar narratives in Central Asia.

","A king and a queen have a beautiful daughter. One day, an old witch tells the queen she and her husband can regain their youth if they kill their daughter and eat her liver and heart. The princess talks to her pet horse, Lurja, and confides in it about the murderous plan. The horse advises her to trick her parents: she is to ask the king and the queen to be dressed as a man and for her to take a ride on the horse to see the world before she dies.
It happens as the horse predicts and the princess seizes the opportunity to escape to another kingdom, in a male disguise. In this new kingdom, the king's son invites her to a hunt. The king's son suspects she is a girl, but his mother insists otherwise and tells him to test her: first by racing; then by going to the war treasury and choose what most appeals to a masculine mind.
The princess is eventually unmasked, but marries the king's as she is. Her husband is invited as guest to another king, and borrows his wife's horse, Lurja. While he is away, she gives birth to a golden-haired son and writes a letter to him. A royal messenger takes the letter to deliver to the prince, but he spends the night in a house, where the contents of the letter are altered to say she gave birth to an abomination. The prince receives the letter and writes back that she and her son are to be kept safe until his return. The messenger passes by the same house, and the prince's letter is falsified with a command to burnt the princess and her son in an oven.
The horse Lurja senses that something is wrong with the princess and, despite one leg being tied to a pole, breaks free and races to the save the princess. He reaches the princess in the nick of time, on three legs, takes the princess and her son, and flies far away. At a safe distance, the horse realizes that being a three-legged beast is of no use to the princess, and urges her to kill it, place its three legs on three corners and its head in the middle. Reluctantly, she follows the horse's instructions and chants a spell; a temple is built in their place. The princess raises her son in this new place.
Meanwhile, the prince returns home and learns of the exchanged letters, and falls into despair, thinking that his wife and son were burnt in the oven. His father, the king, seeing his son's grief, decides to wander the world in search of his daughter-in-law and grandson. He eventually reaches the temple and meets his grandson and his mother."
the_hunchback_of_notre_dame,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame,The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris, lit. 'Our Lady of Paris', originally titled Notre-Dame de Paris. 1482) is a French Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. It details the story of Quasimodo, the disabled bell-ringer of Notre-Dame, as he struggles to stand up to his ableist guardian Claude Frollo, who also wants to commit genocide against Paris' Romani population.
The novel has been described as a key text in French literature and has been adapted for film over a dozen times, in addition to numerous television and stage adaptations, such as a 1923 silent film with Lon Chaney, a 1939 sound film with Charles Laughton, and a 1996 Disney animated film with Tom Hulce (both as Quasimodo).
The novel sought to preserve values of French culture in a time period of great change, which resulted in the destruction of many French Gothic structures. The novel made Notre-Dame de Paris a national icon and served as a catalyst for renewed interest in the restoration of Gothic form.","The story is set in Paris in 1482 during the reign of Louis XI. Esmeralda, a beautiful, sixteen-year-old Romani dancer, is the romantic and sexual interest of many men; including Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers; poet Pierre Gringoire; hunchbacked cathedral bell-ringer Quasimodo, and his guardian Archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards. After he saves her, Esmeralda becomes besotted with Phoebus. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, unwittingly wanders into the ""Court of Miracles"", populated by the Roma and the truands. They are about to hang him for being an outsider, but Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him for four years.
The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for two hours, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.
Later, Frollo follows Phoebus to an inn where he plans to meet Esmeralda and watches as the captain seduces the girl. Inflamed with jealousy, Frollo stabs Phoebus. Esmeralda is arrested and charged with both the attempted murder of Phoebus and of witchcraft, and is sentenced to death by hanging. While imprisoned, awaiting her execution, Esmeralda is visited by Frollo. The Archdeacon professes his love for her and promises to help her escape if she reciprocates. However, recognizing him as Phoebus' true attacker, she angrily rebuffs him. As Esmeralda is being led to the gallows, Quasimodo swings down from Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting her – under the law of sanctuary – from arrest.
Frollo later informs Gringoire that the Court of Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to the sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be executed. Clopin Trouillefou, the leader of the Roma, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the Court of Miracles to charge the Notre-Dame and rescue Esmeralda.
When Quasimodo sees the Roma, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. As Quasimodo defends the cathedral against the invaders, the uproar reaches the king, who is incorrectly informed that those attacking the cathedral are eager for Esmeralda's hanging rather than trying to rescue her. The king orders the authorities to dispatch the invaders and calls for Esmeralda's immediate execution to settle the unrest. In the chaos Esmeralda is taken from the cathedral by Frollo and Gringoire. 
Frollo once again attempts to win Esmeralda's love, but the girl asserts that she would rather die than be with him. Frollo betrays Esmeralda; he goes to alert the authorities while trapping her with Sister Gudule, a reclusive anchoress who bears an extreme hatred for the Roma as she believes they cannibalized her infant daughter. However, it is revealed that Gudule is really Esmeralda's birth mother, and that Esmeralda is Gudule's long-lost daughter Agnes, abducted and raised by the Roma. The two women's joyous reunion is cut short when the king's men arrive to take Esmeralda to the gallows. A desperate Gudule clings to Esmeralda even as she is taken to the place of execution. The guards pull the old woman off her daughter; and she falls to the pavement and dies from the harsh impact. 
From the tower of Notre-Dame, Frollo and Quasimodo witness as Esmeralda is hanged. Frollo laughs triumphantly at Esmeralda's death; upon observing this, Quasimodo pushes the Archdeacon from the height of cathedral to his death. With nothing left to live for, Quasimodo vanishes and is never seen again.
In the epilogue, Quasimodo's deformed skeleton is found many years later embracing another in the charnel house, a mass grave into which the bodies of the destitute and criminals were indiscriminately thrown, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and lay beside her, letting himself slowly die while holding her. As the guards attempt to pull the skeletons apart, his skeleton crumbles to dust."

","A husband complained so much about his wife that she suggested that he stay home and do her work.  He agrees.  He starts to churn butter, but decides to get ale.  He hears the pig upstairs, runs to stop it, but does not arrive in time to keep it from overturning the churn, and forgets the ale, which runs all over the cellar.
He got more milk to churn, but remembered that the cow was still in the barn.  Since he could not take her to the meadow, he decided to put her on the sod roof.  He carried the churn to keep the baby from overturning it, but he went for water for the cow, and spilled all the milk down the well.
It was near dinner and he hadn't any butter.  He set on the water to boil for porridge, but went up to tie the cow so she wouldn't fall off, and tied the end of the rope to himself.  He went to grind grain for the porridge, but the cow fell off, and because he had run the rope through the chimney, it dragged him up.  The wife returned and cut the rope so the cow came down but she found her husband with his head stuck in the pot."

A beggarwoman told her to mark how they slept, and then the youngest, who slept with her hands in her lap, was ill-fated, and her fate kept her sisters from being married.  The youngest daughter heard this, told her mother to sew her dowry into the hem of her skirt, dressed herself as a nun, and left, despite her mother's pleas.

The princess did this, and would not leave until her fate took the bread; the fate resisted a long time, even when the other fates argued with her, but finally gave her silk thread and told her to give it away only for its weight in gold.
A nearby king was marrying, and a quantity of silk was missing to sew the bride's dress.  The princess brought her silk; it was perfect, and they set out to give her the gold, but nothing would even out the scale, until the king himself stepped on the scales.

the_imp_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imp_Prince,The Imp Prince,"The Imp Prince (known as Le Prince Lutin in French)  is a French fairy tale written by Marie Catherine d'Aulnoy and published in her book Fairy Tales (Les Contes des Fees) in 1697.
The word Lutin, in French, can have several translations and meanings. A lutin was like an imp or hobgoblin in the mythology of Normandy, similar to house-spirits of Germany and Scandinavia. Notably, this story gives a description of the Lutin.","The story is about the life of Léandre, a handsome prince who was a human but turned into a lutin (imp) after the ruling prince forced his retreat from court into the countryside.
There was once a king and queen who had a malformed son named Furibon. He was as large as the largest man and small as smallest dwarf, he had an ugly face and a deformed body and mean spirit, but the queen was insane and thought Furibon was the most beautiful child in the world.  Furibon's governor was a rival prince, who had claims to the throne. This governor brought with him his own son named prince Léandre.
Léandre was very well liked in court, the ladies loved him, thought him very handsome and called him the ""beautiful indifferent one"" (translated). Furibon, however, was hated. He insulted people and reported their secret faults to the King and Queen.
One day, ambassadors came from afar and seeing Léandre with Furibon together, they bowed to Léandre thinking he was the prince and thinking Furibon was just a dwarf. They teased Furibon and laughed at him. When no one was looking, Furibon angrily took Léandre by the hair and tore out three handfuls. Thus, Léandre's father sent Léandre to live in a castle in the countryside, to be safely far away from Furibon. In the countryside, Léandre was free to hunt, fish, walk, paint, read and play musical instruments. He was happy but lonely. He found an injured grass snake one evening and brought it home to feed and care for it, hoping it would bring him some joy. One day Furibon came into the woods with assassins to hunt Léandre down and kill him. Léandre decided that he must travel the world and get away from the kingdom once and for all.
Before leaving, Léandre visited the room of the grass snake and found out that it had turned into a beautiful jewel-studded fairy named Gentille. She said she took the form of a snake for 8 days every 100 years and could have been killed. Gentille was indebted to Léandre for protecting her life when she was a  grass snake and offered him all sorts of rewards: riches, a long life, a kingdom with houses full of gold, the life of an excellent orator, poet, musician, or painter. Finally she suggested he become an ""air, water and terrestrial lutin.""  Gentille described the benefits of being a lutin (imp):  ""You are invisible when you like it; you cross in one moment the vast space of the universe; you rise without having wings; you go through the ground without dying; you penetrate the abysses of the sea without drowning; you enter everywhere, though the windows and the doors are closed; and, when you decide to, you can let yourself be seen in your natural form.""
Léandre agreed to be a lutin. So Gentille said ""Be Imp"" and passed her hands three times over his eyes and face. Then she gave him a small red hat, trimmed with two parrot feathers, that would  make him invisible when he wore it.
As an imp, Léandre began to travel. First Léandre took revenge on Furibon and the queen, by sneaking unseen into their palace where he nailed Furibon's ear to a door, beat them a thousand times with a rod used on the king's dogs, and tore up all the fruit and flowers in the queen's garden.
Léandre then traveled far away. In one kingdom he fell in love with a maid of honor named Blondine, but learned by putting a magic pink rose on her throat that she was in love with a hateful musician, so left her kingdom heartbroken.
In three separate adventures, Léandre came to the invisible aid of young maidens by cursing and battling with people that were going to harm them: He saved the first maiden from being married to an old man, another from being sacrificed in a temple by her family, and the third a young girl named Abricotine (which translates to ""Apricot-plum""), who he found enslaved in the forest by four robbers.
After rescuing Abricotine, Léandre learned she was a fairy who lived on a secluded island that was only for females. An old fairy mother had created this island and retreated from the world because she had been hurt in a love affair and so drove out all the male guards and the officers and replaced them with women from the Amazon race instead. She named this place the Island of Quiet Pleasures. Abricotine served the daughter princess who had inherited the Island.  Léandre asked to see the island, but Abricotine could not allow a man inside. So he went invisibly by himself and saw a palace made of pure gold; crystal figures and precious stones, and “all the wonders of nature, sciences and arts, the elements, the sea and fish, the ground and the animals, hunting of Diane with her nymphs, (and) the noble exercises of the Amazons.""
The fairy princess had lived here in seclusion for 600 years, but looked like a young girl of incomparable beauty to him. Léandre pretended to be the voice of the parrots in her house, and told her about a man had saved Abricotine's life, and tried to convince her to give this man (himself) a chance to meet her. The princess appeared interested but suspicious. He stayed invisible a long time in her palace, and listened to her conversations, ate invisibly beside her at her table every night, spoke as the parrot sometimes, and slowly convinced her that she might be able to trust a man. He brought her monkeys and fine clothes from around the world when she mentioned them. The fairy princess could not decide if the invisible presence was good or evil. One day Léandre painted and put a portrait of himself out. She liked it very much, but was afraid it was done by a demon.  Léandre finally wrote her a love note:

Léandre, intending to speak, wrote these words on its shelves and threw them to the feet of the princess:
""No I am not demon nor fairy,
I am an unhappy lover
Who does not dare to appear in your eyes:
Feel sorry for my destiny at least
THE PRINCE LUTIN.""At the same time, Furibon wanted the same princess, and planned to attack the Island of Quiet Pleasures with an army of 1400 men in order to break in and take her. Léandre disguised himself as an Amazon woman and went out to buy off Furibon, giving Furibon rooms full of gold if he left without attacking the island. Furibon planned to take the gold, then kill the Amazon and attack the palace anyway but Léandre put on his hat, and then killed and beheaded Furibon. Furibon's army was happy that the evil Furibon had been killed. Léandre became their new and rightful king, and he spread all the gold among them. Léandre took Furibon's head into the palace to show the fairies they were safe.
Much tired, Léandre went back into the palace and fell asleep as if dead, not wearing his invisibility hat. The princess saw him sleeping, and most of her fears were resolved. Her mother, the ""old hag"" (as translated) who had secluded the island for 600 years, was angry with his appearance and against their marriage.  Léandre's friend Gentille came to his aid and convinced the old fairy to trust Léandre. The marriage festivals were very joyful."
the_iron_stove,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Stove,The Iron Stove,"The Iron Stove (Der Eisenofen) is a fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, as tale number 127. It is Aarne–Thompson type 425A, the animal bridegroom. Dorothea Viehmann prepared the story for the Grimms' collection.","A prince is cursed by a witch and imprisoned in an iron stove in the woods. A lost princess finds the stove and is surprised to find it talking to her, offering to help her find her way back home, provided she return to the woods with a knife to scrape a hole in the stove, thereby freeing the prince, and marry him.
Her father the King, not wanting to give up his only child to a stove in the woods, tries to send substitutes back to the woods including a miller's daughter and a pig-herd's daughter. Although very beautiful, the women betray their origins, and the princess herself reluctantly returns to the woods. When she scrapes with the knife to make a hole, she sees that the prince is very handsome. He wants to take her to his own country, but she wishes to first bid her father farewell. He agrees, but tells her to speak no more than three words. She fails this prohibition, and can not find the iron stove.
In the woods, she finds a cottage full of toads and frogs. They give her shelter for the night, tell her how to find the prince—by climbing a high glass mountain, and crossing three piercing swords and a great lake—and give her gifts—three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. She uses the needles to climb the glass mountain and rolls over the swords on the plough-wheel.

She comes upon a castle where the prince is to be married, as he believes her to have died, and takes a job as a maid. One night she cracks nut and finds inside it a dress. She finds that each nut holds a dress and each dress is more beautiful than the last. The prince's bride asks to buy the first dress, but instead the princess offers a trade. In exchange for the dress, she will be allowed to spend one night in the prince's room. That night the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink so that he sleeps through the night and the princess cannot reveal to him who she is. She weeps and the servants overhear. The second night the princess makes the same bargain with the bride but again the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink so that he sleeps through the night. As the princess weeps, the servants again hear. On the third night the princess trades the last dress for a chance to spend the night in the prince's room. Again the bride gives the prince a sleeping drink but this time the servants have told the prince of the princess' sorrowful pleas, and he does not drink. When the princess begins to weep, he reveals that he is awake and knows that she isn't dead and is his true love.
They steal the bride's clothing so she could not get up and flee, using the ploughwheel and the needles to get back to the cottage of toads and frogs, but when they arrive, it becomes a castle, and the frogs and toads, which were the children of kings, are all transformed back into their true forms. They marry and live there for many years, are reconciled with the princess's father and unite their kingdoms into one."

","All the rivers and streams ran dry.  The animals dug a well to keep from dying, but the jackal did not help.  They set a guard to keep the jackal from drinking.  The first, a rabbit, kept off the jackal until it bribed it with some honeycomb to let it tie it up; then the jackal drank its full.  The second, a hare, met the same fate.  The third, the tortoise, did not answer the jackal, so it thought it could kick it aside, but the tortoise grabbed its leg and never let it go.  The jackal did not manage to free itself until the other animals appeared; then it managed to wrench itself free and flee without drinking."
the_jezinkas,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jezinkas,The Jezinkas,"The Jezinkas is a Bohemian fairy tale collected by A. H. Wratislaw in his Sixty Folk-Tales from Exclusively Slavonic Sources, number 5. Parker Filmore included it, as Grandfather's Eyes, in Czechoslovak Fairy Tales. Ruth Manning-Sanders included, as Johnny and the Witch-Maidens in both A Book of Witches and A Choice of Magic.

","A poor orphan named Johnny (Jeníček) tried to get into service. He travelled far without finding a place. He came to an old man who had caverns in his head instead of eyes, and whose goats were bleating in their stall. The man took him as a goatherd but warned him against the hills: there, the three evil witches, known as the Jezinkas (Jeziňky), would put him to sleep and tear out his eyes.
For two days, Johnny obeyed him, but on the third day, he decided the pasture was better there. He took three shoots of bramble and drove the goats to the hill. A very beautiful and finely-dressed young maiden appeared, offering him an apple; he said he had eaten his fill of apples from his master's apple tree. Another appeared, with a rose, offering to let him smell it; he said he had smelled his fill of the more roses in his master's garden. A third one, who was the youngest and most beautiful of them, offered to comb his hair. He said nothing, but when she came close, he trapped her with the bramble shoot. The other two sisters came and could not undo it, and he then bound them as well despite their protests and weeping.
Johnny fetched his master. Taking the eldest of the Jezinka sisters, he demanded his master's eyes. When she said she did not know, he carried her to the river and threatened to throw her into it. Terrified, she brought him to a cave filled with eyes and gave him two. His master put them in but said he could see nothing but owls. Johnny then did throw the girl into the river and it was the end of her. He did the same with the middle sister, and when she gave his master eyes that saw nothing but wolves, he threw her, too, into the river. With the youngest of the sisters, after she gave his master eyes that saw nothing but pike, he went to drown her as well, but she pleaded with him and gave his master his actual eyes, and so he let her go; she was never seen around again."
the_juniper_tree__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Juniper_Tree_(fairy_tale),The Juniper Tree (fairy tale),"""The Juniper Tree"" (also The Almond Tree; Low German: Von dem Machandelboom) is a German fairy tale published in Low German by the Brothers Grimm in Grimm's Fairy Tales in 1812 (KHM 47). The story contains themes of child abuse, murder, cannibalism and biblical symbolism and is one of the Brothers Grimm's darker and more mature fairy tales.
The tale is of Aarne–Thompson type 720 (""The Juniper Tree""). Another such tale is the English The Rose-Tree, although it reverses the sexes from The Juniper Tree; The Juniper Tree follows the more common pattern of having the dead child be a boy.

","A wealthy and pious couple pray every day for God to grant them a child. One winter, under the juniper tree in the courtyard, the wife peels an apple. She cuts her finger and drops of blood fall onto the snow. This leads her to wish for a child to be as white as snow and as red as blood. Six months later, the wife becomes gravely ill from eating juniper berries and asks her husband to bury her beneath the juniper tree if she dies. A month later, she gives birth to a baby boy as white as snow and as red as blood. She dies of happiness. Keeping his promise, the husband buries her beneath the juniper tree. He eventually marries again and he and his new wife have a daughter named Marlinchen (in some versions Marlene, Marjory or Ann Marie).
The new wife loves Marlinchen but despises her stepson. She abuses him every day, claiming that she wishes Marlinchen to inherit her father's wealth instead of her stepson. One afternoon after school, the stepmother plans to lure her stepson into an empty room containing a chest of apples. Marlinchen sees the chest and asks for an apple, which the stepmother gracefully offers. However, when the boy enters the room and reaches down the chest for an apple, the stepmother slams the lid onto his neck, decapitating him. The stepmother binds his head with the rest of his body with a bandage and props his body onto a chair outside, with an apple on his lap. Marlinchen, unaware of the situation, asks her stepbrother for an apple. Hearing no response, she is forced by her mother to box him in the ear, causing his head to roll onto the ground. Marlinchen profusely cries throughout the day whilst the stepmother dismembers the stepson's body and cooks him into a ""blood-soup"" (Black Puddings Sauer/Suur) for dinner. She later deceives her husband by telling him that his son stayed at the mother's great uncle's house. The husband unwittingly eats the ""blood-soup"" (Black puddings/Sauer/Suur) during dinner and proclaims it to be delicious. Marlinchen gathers the bones from the dinner and buries them beneath the juniper tree with a handkerchief.
Suddenly, a mist emerges from the juniper tree and a beautiful bird flies out. The bird visits the local townspeople and sings about its brutal murder at the hands of its stepmother. Captivated by its lullaby, a goldsmith, a shoemaker and a miller offer the bird a gold chain, a pair of red shoes and a millstone in return for the bird singing its song again. The bird returns home to give the gold chain to the husband while giving Marlinchen the red shoes. Meanwhile, the stepmother complains about the ""raging fires within her arteries"", revealed to be the real cause of her anger and hatred towards her stepson. She goes outside for relief but the bird drops the millstone onto her head, killing her instantly. Surrounded by smoke and flames, the son, revealed to be the bird, emerges and reunites with his family. They celebrate and head inside for lunch, and live happily ever after."
the_king_who_would_be_stronger_than_fate,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_Who_Would_Be_Stronger_Than_Fate,The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate,"""The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate"" is an Indian fairy tale, included by Andrew Lang in The Brown Fairy Book.

","A king with a daughter once was lost while hunting and met a hermit, who prophesied that his daughter would marry a slave woman's son, who belonged to the king of the north.  As soon as he left the forest, he sent an offer to the king of the north for the slave woman and her son.  The other king made him a present of them.  He took them into the forest and cut off the woman's head, and left the child there.
A widow who raised goats found that her best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk.  She followed the animal when it went to the child, and thought she had at last a son to look after her in her old age.
When the boy was grown, a peddler's donkey started to eat his mother's cabbages, and so he beat it and drove it out.  The tale was borne to the peddler, with added claims that the boy had threatened to kill the peddler.  The peddler complained to the king, who sent men to seize the boy.  The old woman pleaded for his life, because she needed him to support her.  The king, not believing that so old a woman could have so young a son, demanded to know where she had gotten him, and hearing the story, knew who the child was.
The king let him off if he joined the army.  When the army life did not kill him, though he was sent on the most dangerous missions, and he proved a good soldier, he was enrolled in the king's bodyguard and saved him from an assassin.  The king was obliged to make him an attendant, and in his missions for the king, he was continually attacked but always escaped.  Finally, the king sent him with a message to a distant governor, who had charge of the princess.  The mischievous princess was up and about while the rest of the castle slept in the heat of the day and found that the message was to kill the bearer of it.  She substituted a letter ordering the governor to marry him to the princess.
The king, on receiving the news, abandoned his efforts to harm the boy."
the_king_of_england_and_his_three_sons,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_England_and_his_Three_Sons,The King of England and his Three Sons,"The King of England and his Three Sons is a Romani fairy tale collected by Joseph Jacobs in More English Fairy Tales. He listed as his source Francis Hindes Groome's In Gypsy Tents, where the informant was John Roberts, a Welsh Roma. Groome published the tale as An Old King and his three Sons in England.A version of this tale appears in The Red King and the Witch: Gypsy Folk and Fairy Tales by Ruth Manning-Sanders, under the title An Old King and His Three Sons of England.

","An old king could be cured only by golden apples from a far country. His three sons set out to find them, and parted ways at a crossroads. The youngest son found a house in a forest, where an old man greeted him as a king's son, and told him to put his horse in the stable and have something to eat. After the meal, he asked how the man knew he was a king's son, and the man said he knew many things, including what the prince was doing. He told the prince that he had to stay there the night, though many snakes and toads would crawl over him, and if he stirred, he would turn into one himself.
The prince got little sleep but did not stir. In the morning, the old man gave him breakfast, a new horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between the horse's ears. When the prince threw it and chased it, he came to the old man's brother, who was uglier than the first one. He received the same hospitality, and the same unpleasant night, and this brother sent him on to the third brother.
At the third brother's, the brother, who was even uglier than the second one, told him he must go on to a castle. There, he must tell swans to bear him over the lake to a castle. It was guarded by giants, lions, and dragons, but they would be asleep, and so he must go in at one o'clock and come out again by two. He must go through some grand rooms, go down into the kitchen, and then go out into the garden. There he must pick the apples. He should come back the same way, and when riding off, never look back because they would pursue him until he nearly reached the old man's house.
He went to bed, and this time the brother assured him that nothing would disturb him, and nothing did. In the morning, the old man warned him not to tarry because of a beautiful woman.
He reached the castle by the swans and saw a beautiful woman there. He exchanged his garter, gold watch, and pocket-handkerchief for hers, and kissed her. Then he got the apples and had to flee with all speed, because the hour was nearly up, but he escaped.
The old man brought him to a well and insisted that the prince cut the old man's head off and throw it into the well. This turned him into a young, handsome man, and the house into a palace. At the second brother's, he received a new bed, with no snakes or toads, and cut off his head as well, and then the same with the first.
He met up with his brothers again. They stole his apples and put others in their place, and went on before him. When he reached home, his apples were not as good as his brother's, and his father thought they were poisoned and told his headsman to cut his head off. The headsman instead took him into the woods and left him there. A bear came up to him, and he climbed a tree, but the bear persuaded him to come down. The bear brought him to some tents, where they made him welcome, and changed in a handsome young man, Jubal. He stayed with them and was happy, although he had lost the golden watch somewhere. One day, he saw it in the tree where he had climbed to hide from the bear, and climbed it to get it again.
Meanwhile, the princess, realizing one of the king's sons had been there, set out with an army. When she reached the king, she demanded to see his sons. When the oldest came, he said he had been to her castle, but when she threw down the handkerchief and he walked over it, he broke his leg; then the second brother said the same, but also broke his leg. She demanded of the king whether he had more sons; the king sent to the headsman, who confessed he had not killed the prince, and the king said he must find him, to save the king's life. They found Jubal, who pointed to the tree where the prince was, and they told the prince he must come because a lady was looking for him, and they brought Jubal with them. He did not break his leg over the handkerchief, and the princess knew he was the prince, so they married, and went back to her castle."

","A king went hunting.  Near evening, he saw the first animal, a black pig, and so chased it.  The pig swam out to sea, and the king followed it.  His horse drowned, but he swam and saw an island.  On it, he found a house with razors on the threshold and needles on the lintel, but he jumped between them and sat by the fire.  A meal came, without his seeing anyone bring it, and he ate.  At night, he sensed a woman in the room but could not touch her.  He tried to leave the next two days, but the woman used magic to keep him from finding his way.  On the third night, the woman appeared and said she had been the pig; she and her two sisters were captive there until their son should free them.  In the morning, she gave him a boat to get back, and nine months later, she had a son.
When her son was grown, she wept one day, and explained that the king of Erin would die the next day, because the king of Spain had brought a great army against him.  The son said he would help if he were there, and the mother sent him by magic.  He asked the king of Spain for a day's truce and went to the king of Erin as a guest.  The next day, he arrayed himself as a champion and drove the king of Spain's army from the field.  The king of Erin had two sons, cowards who had hidden from the fight, but their mother told the king that the champion was the older of them.  During the feasting, the queen gave the champion a drink that made him drowsy and then pushed him from the window into the sea, but he swam for four days and nights until he came to a rock where he lived for three months.  A ship rescued him; the captain had tried to reach the Lonesome Island and failed because of fire.  With the son, he succeeded, and the son told his mother what had happened with the queen.
The new king of Spain came to avenge his father's death, and the mother sent her son again; the queen made the same claim about her older son and put some chicken blood into her mouth, claiming it was her heart's blood and she needed water from Tubber Tintye to recover.  The son went for it with her two sons.  They met a woman washing her hair in a golden basin.  She called the son her sister-son and told him it was too hard.  They stayed the night, and the next morning the older of the queen's sons claimed to be ill and unable to go on.  They went on to another aunt of the son's.  At this house, she told him that the people of Tubber Tintye slept for seven years and woke for seven years, and learned from an eagle they had just gone to sleep.  The younger of the queen's son claimed to be ill and unable to go on.  The aunt gave her nephew a bridle and told him to shake it before the stables and take whatever horse came out.  He took the dirty, lean, shaggy little horse that came.  It called him the son of the king of Erin and the queen of the Lonesome Island, which was the first the son had heard of his father.  The horse leapt over the river of fire, and the son jumped from its back into the window at the castle.  He found many monsters and then a chamber with the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.  He went on through twelve more chambers, each with a sleeping woman more beautiful than the last, until at last he came to the golden room, where the queen slept, with the well at her feet.  He decided to stay there, and did for six days and nights.  A table there had a loaf of bread and a leg of meat, and if every man in Erin had eaten from that table from a year, there would have been as much food on it at the end.  He left a letter so that the queen might know that he was the one who had been there, and took the bread and the meat.  He sprang from the window back onto the back of the horse.
The horse carried him away and had him chop it into four quarters and strike them with a rod; this turned them back into the four princes that they had been before.  He freed his two aunts from their spell and went back with them and the queen's sons.  The older of the queen's sons stole the water and gave it to his mother.  The son went back with his aunts to the Lonesome Island.
After seven years, the queen of Tubber Tintye woke and found she had a six-year-old son.  Her sage said only a hero could have made it there, and a hero would have left some sign.  They found his letter, which pleased the queen.  She brought her army to the castle of the king of Erin and demanded the man who had come to her castle while she slept.  The king summoned the queen's two son in turn, each of whom claimed to have done it, but she demanded that each one ride her horse, and it threw and killed them.  The king sent a message to the Lonesome Island, and the queen there and her son came.  He could ride the horse, and so she knew he was the man.  She put a belt on the queen of Erin that magically tightened, and forced from her the knowledge that her older son was the gardener's, and the younger the brewer's.  The queen of Tubber Tintye had the king of Erin burn her.    The king of Erin married the queen of the Lonesome Island, and his son married the queen of Tubber Tintye."

","One day he took his youngest daughter, Rosella, with him, and she pulled up a radish. A Turk appeared and said she must come to his master and be punished. He brought them underground, where a green bird appeared, washed in milk, and became a man. The Turk told what had happened. The father said that there was no sign that the radish had belonged to him. The man married Rosella and gave her father a sack of gold. One day, while the man was away, her sisters visited her. She told them that her husband had forbidden her to ask who he was, but they persuaded her to ask his name. He told her that he was the King of Love and vanished.
She wandered in search of him, calling for him, and an ogress appeared, demanding to know why Rosella called on her nephew.  The ogress took pity on her and let her stay the night, telling her that she was one of seven sister ogresses, and the worst was her mother-in-law.  Each day, Rosella met another; on the seventh day, a sister of the King of Love told Rosella to climb her hair into the house while their mother was out.  Then she and her sisters told Rosella to seize their mother and pinch her until the ogress cried out to be left alone in her son's name.
Rosella did this, and the ogress wanted to eat her, but the ogress's daughters stopped her.  Then she insisted that Rosella carry a letter for her.  In the wilderness, Rosella called on the King of Love again.  He warned her to flatter things along the way:  to drink from and praise two rivers, to eat and praise fruit from an orchard, to eat bread from an oven and praise it, to feed two dogs, to sweep a hall, and to polish a knife, razor and scissors.  Then she was to deliver the letter, seize a box from the table, and run.  When she did this, the ogress called after her for things to destroy her, but they refused because of her kindness.  Curious, she opened the box; musical instruments escaped, and she had to call on her husband again to get them back.
The ogress wanted to eat Rosella again but her daughters stopped her again.  She ordered her to fill a mattress with feathers from all the birds in the air.  The King of Love got the King of Birds to have the birds fill the mattress.  Then the ogress married her son to the daughter of the King of Portugal, and had Rosella hold the torches for the bridal chamber; but the king got his bride to switch places with Rosella, and the ground opened up and swallowed the bride.
The ogress declared that Rosella's child would not be born until she unclasped her hands.  The King of Love had his body laid out as if he were dead, and his sisters lamented him.  The ogress unclasped her hands, demanding to know how he had died.  Rosella's son was born.  This so enraged the ogress that she died."

It can be categorised as a ""death of an elf (or cat)"" tale: Aarne–Thompson–Uther type 113A, or Christiansen migratory legend type 6070B.

","A man travelling alone sees a cat (or hears a voice), who speaks to him, saying to tell someone (often an odd name, presumably unknown to the character) that someone else (normally a similarly odd name) has died, though other versions simply have the traveller see a group of cats holding a royal funeral. He reaches his destination and recounts what happened, when suddenly the housecat cries something like ""Then I am the king of the cats!"", rushes up the chimney or out of the door, and is never seen again."

","A merchant with a young son and daughter lost everything except a field.  Walking in that field, he met a black mannikin (dwarf) who promised to make him rich if, in twelve years, he brought the first thing that rubbed against his leg when he went home.  The merchant agreed.  When he got home, his boy rubbed against his leg.  He went to the attic and found money, but when the twelve years were up, he grew sad.  His son got the story from him and assured him that the black man had no power over him.  The son had himself blessed by the priest and went to argue with the black man.  Finally, the mannikin agreed that the boy could be put in a boat and shoved off into the water.
The boat carried him to another shore.  A snake met him, but was a transformed princess.  She told him if for three nights he let twelve black men beat him, she would be freed.  He agreed and did it, and she married him, making him the King of the Golden Mountain, and in time bore him a son.  When the boy was seven, the king wanted to see his own parents.  His wife thought it would bring evil, but gave him a ring that would wish him to his parents and back again, telling him must not wish her to come with him.  He went, but to get in the town, he had to put off his fine and magnificent clothing for a shepherd's; once inside, first he had to persuade his parents that he was their son, and then he could not persuade him that he was a king.  Frustrated, he wished his wife and son with him.  When he slept, his wife took the ring and wished herself and their son back to the Golden Mountain.
He walked until he found three giants quarreling over their inheritance:  a sword that would cut off all heads but the owner's, if ordered to; a cloak of invisibility; and boots that would carry the wearer anywhere.  He said he had to try them first, and with them, went back to the Golden Mountain, where his wife was about to marry another man. But at the banquet she was unable to enjoy any of the food or wine because the hero would invisibly take them away and consume them. The dismayed queen ran to her chamber, whereupon the hero revealed himself to her, rebuking her betrayal. Now addressing himself to the guests in the hall, he declared the wedding called off, as he was the rightful ruler, asking the guests to leave. As they refused to do this, and tried to seize him, the hero invoked the command to his magic sword, and all other heads rolled off. He had now again assumed his place as King of the Golden Mountain."

One of them, who becomes the ruler of the snakes, discovers how to alternate between human and snake forms, becomes human and owns a great state in the human realm. In this state, there is a beautiful garden unlike any other in the Flowery Kingdom.
One day, this Prince of Snakes sees an old man plucking flowers in his own gardens and, irritated, asks the old man the reason for his presence. The old man answers he is just plucking flowers for his four daughters, of varying charm and beauty: the eldest pock-faced and the fourth the most beautiful. He ponders on this information and demands the old man sends the fourth daughter to him as his bride in ten days time, lest he sends them a troop of snakes to devour him and his family.
The men returns home and tells the situation to his daughters. The three elders refuse to marry the snake, despite his threat, but the youngest, Almond Blossom, being the ""most devotedly filial"", offers to go in her father's place. The fairies listen to her plea and, touched by her devotion, send one of their own to protect her against her enemies.
On the appointed time, a sedan-chair comes to their house to get Almond Blossom as the snake's bride and to take her to her future husband. The father follows behind his daughter some days later and reaches the snake's palace. He is greeted by his daughter, who looks very pleased with her new life: a loving husband and a lavish palace. She tells her father her husband is on a journey and sends him back to his humble house with extravagant gifts.
After the father returns home, he shows the grand presents to his daughters. The eldest sister begins to nurture a jealous heart and decides to visit her youngest. She goes and admires the whole palace. She convinces Almond Blossom to show her around the property. They reach an empty well. The eldest sister shoves her own sister down the well.
After some time, the eldest sister still at the snake king's palace, a little bird flies out of the well and begins to sing a song with almost human-like qualities. The eldest sister, fearing that the bird will reveal the truth, snap the bird's neck and throws it outside the house. Some time later, a clump of bamboos grow up on the spot of the bird's remains. The eldest sister, sensing that the bamboos will also reveal the truth, gets an axe, chops them down.
Some of the snake king's servants see the chopped down bamboos and take some of them to fashion a new chair. The Snake King finally returns home and asks about his wife. The eldest sister spins a story about seeing her by the well, then nothing else, and the servants also not knowing her whereabouts. Suddenly, the chair turns into Almond Blossom, who accuses her sister of trying to kill her. Enraged, the snake king orders the execution of his sister-in-law."

moorland canach, a silk dress that stood on the ground with gold and silver, a gold shoe and a silver shoe, and a chest that could lock inside and out, and travel over land and sea. When she got the chest, she put her clothing in it and got in herself, and asked her father to put it to sea, so she could see how well it worked. It carried her off to another shore.
There, a herder-boy would have broken it open, but she got him to get his father instead. She stayed with his father for a time, and went into service at the king's house, in the kitchen. She refused to go to the sermon because she had bread to bake, and sneaked off to go dressed in the swan-down dress and the king's son fell in love with her. She went again, in the moorland canach dress, and then in that of gold and silver, with the shoes, but the third time, the king's son had set a guard, and she escaped, but leaving a shoe behind.

When the boys were grown, they decided to travel. At a crossroad, they parted ways. One found a city grieving, because every year a maiden had to be offered up to a dragon, and this year the lot had fallen on the princess. He went to see where the princess was, and then left her to fetch a mirror. He told her to cover it with her veil and hide behind it; when the dragon approached, she was to tear the veil off. She did, and the dragon stared at his rival, identical to him. He threatened it until he finally smashed it to pieces, but as every fragment reflected him, he thought he too had been smashed. While it was still baffled, the knight killed it. The king married him to his daughter.

Everyone thought she had killed and eaten the child, and the prince's mother would have had her burned if the prince had not pleaded for her.  The same thing happened the second time, though the watch was twice as strong; the foster mother decreed that the girl would be as sorry as the foster mother had been when she had let out the Moon.  The third time, the watch was three times as strong, the foster mother decreed that she would be as sorry as the foster mother when she let out the Sun, and the prince was unable to save her.  But when they were leading her to the fire, the foster mother reappeared with the children, restoring them to their parents, said that the girl had been sufficiently punished, revealed that she was the Virgin Mary, and restored her speech.

It told the boy it would go into the wild and kill all the creatures it finds, except a dragon, which will kill it.  It told the boy to climb a tree, and once it was dead, to skin it and take its bladder, which would make anything it struck drop dead.  With it, he was to kill the dragon.

The boy set out to find the dragon and kill it.  He found a princess who had been staked out for the dragon.  He killed it, though it bit off his forefinger.  He said he must leave her, but first he cut out the dragon's tongue and the princess gave him a diamond ring.  The princess told her father, who asked for him to come, and many gentlemen cut off their forefingers and brought diamond rings and the tongues of all kinds of beasts, but none were the dragon's tongue or the princess's ring.

Ruth Manning-Sanders included a variant, as ""The Girl in the Basket"", in A Book of Ogres and Trolls.

","Once there was a man had to pay the king rent in the form of four baskets of pears. One year his trees yielded only three and a half baskets full, so he put his youngest daughter in the fourth basket to fill it up. When the baskets arrived at the castle, the royal servants found the girl by the pears she ate, and they set her to work as a servant. As the girl, named Perina (from pear), grew up, she and the prince fell in love, which caused the other maidservants to grow envious. In Manning-Sander's version, the servants told the king that she had boasted of doing all the laundry in one day; with the prince's aid, she was able to do it.
In most other versions, the maids then tell the king that she had also boasted that she could steal the witch's (or ogress's, depending on the version) treasure. The king insisted that she do it.
In Manning-Sanders had the prince told her what to do. Although Calvino found this in his original version, to increase her identification with the pears, she went and passed by an apple tree and a peach tree to sleep in the third, a pear tree. In the morning, a little old woman was under the tree.In both cases, they gave her grease, bread, and millet. She went on, gave the millet to three women in a bakery, sweeping out the ovens with their hair, threw the bread to some mastiffs, crossed by a red river with a charm that the little old woman had given her, and greased the hinges of the witch's house. Then she took the treasure chest. The chest began to speak, but the door refused to slam on her, the river to drown her, the dogs to eat her, and the women in the bakery to bake her.
Curious, she opened the chest and a golden hen with her chicks escaped, or musical instruments that played on their own, but the little old woman or prince put them back. The prince told her to ask, for her reward, for the coal chest in the cellar. When she asked and it was brought up, the prince was hidden in it, so they married."

She found a cooked partridge for herself on the table.  She exchanged the peas for better food this way, but feared for her child.  Finding the mouse playing with straw, she wove a basket and rope from them, to lower the child once born.  One day, she saw an old woman there.  The woman offered to help her if she would throw her the mouse, which she loved to eat; the queen refused, and the woman stalked off.  The baby was born, and the queen named her Joliette and went to lower her.  The mouse jumped in the basket, and the queen told it that if she had sacrificed it, she might have saved her baby.  The mouse turned into the fairy and offered to care for the child.

He obeyed until he reached the horse, when he thought it should have a harness as well, but when he laid hands on it, everyone woke.  The lord took a fancy to him and let him go, and he returned to the frog.
After he convinced it of his regret, it sent him back with a grain of gold, and told him to find a room and take off a maiden there, without heed to her resistance.  He obeyed until she asked to put on a dress first; this woke them all, and only by the fairies' intervention was he freed.
The frog sent him back with a grain of diamond and told him to find the garden, and cut off the branch with the bird he sought on it.  This time he obeyed, and when he returned, he found a little rustic palace, with the maiden he had seen in the mirror.  She told him that she had long admired him but never dreamed that he could see her.  She told him that she had been the frog; that her name was Serpentine, and she knew nothing else of her family; and that fairies had raised her.  She refused to marry him because he was a prince and she could not name her family.
A fairy arrived, to tell them the truth, and bring Aglantino to them; then she carried them to Peridor's castle.  The bird proved to be Constance, and Saphir and Serpentine were married."

Nastasya becomes the owner of the Malachite Casket, filled with jewellery, which Stepan got from the legendary Mistress of the Copper Mountain. Only Tanyushka likes to play with the Casket, and every piece of jewellery looks good on her. With black hair and green eyes, Tanyushka does not look like her mother at all, as if she was born to different parents. Her appearance resembles that of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain.
A female vagabond comes to their house and stays for a while, teaching Tanyushka silk embroidering. Nastasya is not happy with the arrangement, because she feels that Tanyushka ""doesn't want to come to her own mother, but hugs a tramp"". Nevertheless they become very close. One day, when the woman is alone with Tanyushka, the girl shows her the jewellery from the Malachite Casket, and in return the woman shows her a vision of a beautiful room decorated with malachite. She explains that the Malachite Room of the Tsar's palace is decorated with the malachite that Stepan mined. Next day the mysterious woman leaves Nastasya's house. Before she leaves, she presents the girl with a small button for a ""remembrance"".
Meanwhile Tanyushka grows up. She becomes an incredibly skilled needleworker and a great beauty, but keeps to herself and avoids other girls' company. People start calling her ""a stone statue"". A lot of young men at the Polevaya factory are attracted to her, but do not dare to approach her because of her coldness. Nastasya blames this behaviour on the vagabond ""sorceress"". One day a tragedy occurs in the family: the house is burned to the ground. Nastasya has to sell the Malachite Casket. A lot of merchants are interested in the jewellery. At the same time, a new bailiff arrives at the factory. He is quickly nicknamed ""Flogger"" (Russian: Паротя, tr. Parotya) because he always orders flagellation as a form of punishment. The bailiff is married to the mistress of the local landlord's son, and this rich woman eventually buys the Casket. However she cannot wear the jewellery because every piece of it pains her. She asks various craftsmen to fix it for her, but all of them refuse to touch the gemstones, explaining that none of the masters is willing to quarrel with their maker and they were made to fit one person only. Flogger's wife gives up and decides to resell the Casket at earliest convenience.
When the old landlord dies, his son wants his mistress back. Flogger is angry at first, but when he hears of Tanyushka's beauty and comes to see her, he is smitten. He tries to court the girl, but Tanyushka is very cold with him. The landlord's son, the noble man named Turchaninov, finally comes for Flogger's wife. When Tanyushka catches his eye, he forgets about his mistress.  He buys the Casket from her and offers it to Tanyushka, but she refuses. Turchaninov then claims that he wishes to marry the girl. She announces that she will only agree to the marriage if he shows her the Tsarina herself at the Malachite Room in Saint Petersburg. Turchaninov agrees. Dressed like a queen, Tanyushka arrives at the Palace, and walks directly to the Malachite Room. Tsarina enters the room, saying: ""Now then, show me this nigh-handed maid"". Upon hearing that Tanyushka frowns and says to Turchaninov: ""What does this mean? I told ye to show me the Tsarina, and you've done it so as to show me to her. [...] I don't want to see any more of ye"". Adding that he is no match for her anyway, Tanyushka leans against the malachite wall and melts away. She is never seen again, but the Mistress of the Copper Mountain gets a twin—people see two maids in malachite robes."

It is related to the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom and distantly related to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche, in that the heroine is forced to perform difficult tasks for a witch.

","A man and a girl work at a farm. The man gifts the girl a black ribbon, which is stolen by a fox. The man goes after the fox and ends up at a country mansion. The girl hangs some clothes on the hanger at the farm, which are snatched by the same fox. The girl chases after the animal and arrives at the same mansion. The girl becomes a servant and is made to unload a dung heap and to wash a black cloth white as part of her tasks.
A man offers to help her in exchange for becoming the girl's sweetheart. The girl declines his offer, but the man helps her anyway: he strikes the dung heap and the cloth with a red wand. Next, the girl learns the man is set to be married to the farmer's daughter, and the girl is ordered to get jewels for the upcoming wedding. The man warns her that the jewel box belongs to a witch, and on the way there, she must fix a broken plank of a bridge, milk a cow, give water to a bull, shake a tree, enter the witch's house and accept the food she will offer (a milk bowl), but give it to the dog. The girl follows the instructions to the letter and gets the jewel box from the witch. The girl escapes, despite the witch commanding the dog, the cow, the bull, the tree and the bridge to stop her.

the_man_of_stone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_of_Stone,The Man of Stone,"The Man of Stone (Omul de piatră) is a Romanian fairy tale collected by Petre Ispirescu in Legende sau basmele românilor.

","A king and queen had no children.  A black man or Arab came to the king and offered a potion that would make the queen pregnant.  The cook prepared it and, not knowing its powers, tasted some before coming to the queen.  Both the cook and the queen became pregnant and each gave birth to a son.
When the prince was grown, the king had to go to war.  He gave the keys to the castle and told him not to go into the door locked by the golden key.  The prince went into it and found a spy glass that showed him the beautiful Princess Kiralina, and he fell so in love with her that he was sick and near dying.  The king sent messengers but her father refused to let them marry.  The prince decided to go ask her himself, and his foster brother, the cook's son, went with him.  
They came to a hut where an old woman could not tell them; her son, the North Wind, might turn them to ice, so she sent them on to the Wild Wind.  They could not stay there, either, but went on the house of the Spring Wind.  The wind's mother, a tall and elegant woman, hid them because her son might kill them.  When the wind came, his mother asked him how to reach Princess Kiralina, and the wind told her how it would take ten years; a fairy log, in a black forest by a river of pitch, could carry anyone there instantly, but whoever told that would turn to stone to his knees.  Once there, the person had to make a golden stag and use it to smuggle himself into the princess's room, but whoever knew that would be turned to stone up to his waist.  If that succeeded and the princess married, the Northwind's mother would spitefully send her a dress of cobwebs, and unless she washed in the tears of doves, she would be killed.  The prince slept through it, but the cook's son heard it.
The cook's son told the prince to trust him and carried him to the princess by the log.  The princess fell in love with him at sight and grew ill with longing.  A hag told the king that a golden stag, put in her room, would cure her.  The cook's son turned the log into a golden stag and hid the prince inside it.  The cook's son agreed to hire it to the king, and the king brought it to the princess's room.  At night the prince sneaked from the form and kissed the princess; the next night, she feigned sleep and caught him.  When the cook's son came to take it back, the princess came alongside it, and the cook's son turned the stag into a chariot that carried them all off.  The prince and princess married.  
Later, when the princess was queen, she bought a gown of cobwebs.  Secretly, the cook's son sprinkled her with the tears of doves, but was seen and accused of kissing the queen.  The prince, now a king, ordered him beheaded.  The cook's son explained what he had heard and was turned to stone.  Later, the king and queen had a child and dreamed if they killed the child and put the blood on the statue, it would come to life.  They did, and the statue did.  The cook's son pricked his finger and put the blood on the dead child, who came back to life."

""Master"" indicates ""superior, skilled."" Jørgen Moe wrote the tale down from the storyteller Anne Godlid in Seljord on a short visit in the autumn of 1842. Andrew Lang translated the tale to English and included it in his The Blue Fairy Book (1889). A later translation was made by George Dasent, in his Popular Tales from the North.It is Aarne–Thompson type 313. Others of this type include ""The Two Kings' Children"", ""The Water Nixie"", ""Jean, the Soldier, and Eulalie, the Devil's Daughter"", ""Nix Nought Nothing"", and ""Foundling-Bird"".

","A king's youngest son set out to seek his fortune and was hired by a giant.  The first morning, the giant went out to bring his goats to pasture and ordered the son to clean out the stables and to not go into any of the rooms about the one where he slept.

The son disobeys and finds three pots bubbling with no fire, and one turns things into copper, the second into silver, and the third into gold.  Past them, he finds, in one room, the Master Maid.  She warns him that cleaning the stables as ordinary people do causes ten shovelfuls to fly back in for every one he takes out, but if he shovels with the handle, he will be able to do it.  He talks with her the day long, and they agree to marry.  In the evening, he set to his task.  He finds that she is telling the truth, and succeeds.  The giant accuses him of having spoken with the Master Maid and the prince denies it.
The next day, the giant orders him to bring in a horse from pasture.  The Master Maid warns him that it breathes fire, but if he uses a bit, hanging behind the door, he will succeed.  When he does, the giant accuses him of speaking with the Master Maid again, and the prince denies it.
The third day, the giant orders him to  go to Hell and get his fire tax.  The Master Maid tells him the directions, and that he should ask for as much as he can carry.  He retrieves it, though the man who lets him says it was well that he did not ask for a horse-load. The giant accuses him of speaking with the Master Maid again, and the prince denies it.
The fourth day, the giant brings him to the Master Maid and orders her to kill him and make him into a stew.  Then he lies down to sleep.  The Master Maid cuts her finger and lets three drops of blood fall onto a stool.  Then she puts all sorts of rubbish into a stew pot and sets it to stew.  Taking a chest full of golddust, a lump of salt, a flask of water, a golden apple, and two golden chickens, she sets out with the prince.  They reach the sea and start sailing over it.
The giant asks, three times, whether the stew is done, and the drops of blood answer him.  The third says that it is done.  The giant gets up and tries some, and realizes what the Master Maid has done.

Seeing them sailing, he sets a monster to drink up the sea, but the Master Maid has the prince throw down the salt, and it transforms into a mountain, cutting off the water.  The giant sends for a monster to bore through the hill, but when he reaches the other side, the Master Maid has the prince refill the ocean by pouring the flask of water into it.  The monster drinks it up again, but before the giant can catch the couple, they reach the prince's father's lands.
The prince is unwilling that she should walk into his father's castle and proposes that he should fetch a coach and seven to carry her.  She says that he will forget her, and he says that he will never.  She makes him promise to go straight home and only fetch the horses, neither speaking to anyone nor eating anything.
He finds a wedding party for one of his brothers, and sets about getting the coach.  The wedding guests, finding he will not come in, go out with food, and when he is about to ride off, the bride's sister rolls an apple to him, and he bites it and forgets the Master Maid.
The Master Maid finds a dirty old hut, where an old woman lives, to stay.  She says she will clean it up and puts gold in the pot on the fires.  The gold bubbles up and gilds the cottage.  The old woman is so frightened she flees, and the Master Maid lives there.
A constable finds her and wants her to marry him.  She sends him off for a sackful of gold, and then she says she must bank the fire.  The constable says he will do it, and once he has the poker, she says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will shovel red-hot coals over himself all night.  And so he does. As soon as day broke, and he finally was able to rid himself of the poker, he set off as though the bailiff or the devil were after him.
A clerk finds her the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must shut the door.  The clerk says he will, and once he has the door latch, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will go back and forth all night.  And so he does.
A sheriff finds her in the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must bring in a calf.  The sheriff says he will, and once he has it by the tail, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will tour the world all night.  And so he does.
The next morning, her prince was to marry, to the bride's sister who had rolled the apple to him, but as the coach was setting out, a harness pin broke, and so did any pin they replaced it with.  The constable says that if they borrowed the poker from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.
But the coach bottom broke, and so did any bottom they replaced it with.  The clerk says that if they borrowed the door from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.
But then the horses would not pull, no matter how hard they were whipped.  The sheriff says that if they borrowed the calf from the Master Maid, it will pull the coach, and they do so, and it does.

The prince insists on inviting the Master Maid to the wedding feast.
The Master Maid puts the golden apple on the table and then the golden chickens, which start to fight over the apple.   The prince comments on it, and the Master Maid says that it was just as they fought to get away from the giant, and his memory is restored, so he marries the Master Maid instead of the bride's sister. The bride's sister is killed for being a witch."
the_master_thief,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Thief,The Master Thief,"""The Master Thief"" is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Peter Chr. Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. The Brothers Grimm included a shorter variant as tale 192 in their fairy tales. Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book. George Webbe Dasent included a translation of the tale in Popular Tales From the Norse. It is Aarne–Thompson type 1525A, Tasks for a Thief.

","A poor cottager had nothing to give his three sons, so he walked with them to a crossroad, where each son took a different road.  The youngest went into a great woods, and a storm struck, so he sought shelter in a house.  The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.
They set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.
The man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.
The man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.
The robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.
He decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.  The son caught three hares and released them near the squire's kitchen, and the people there, thinking it was one hare, went out to catch it, and the son got in and stole the roast.

The priest made fun of him, and when the Master Thief came to claim his reward, the squire asked him to prove his skill further, by playing some trick on the priest. The Master Thief dressed up as an angel and convinced the priest that he was come to take him to heaven.  He dragged the priest over stones and thorns and threw him into the goose-house, telling him it was purgatory, and then stole all his treasure.
The squire was pleased, but still put off the Master Thief, telling him to steal twelve horses from his stable, with twelve grooms in their saddles.  The Master Thief prepared and disguised himself as an old woman to take shelter in the stable, and when the night grew cold, drank brandy against it.  The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.
The squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift. The Master Thief made up a dummy like a man and put it at the window, and the squire shot at it.  The Master Thief let it drop.  Fearing talk, the squire went to bury it, and the Master Thief, pretending to be the squire, got the sheet and the shift on the pretext they were needed to clean the blood up.
The squire decided that he was too afraid of what the thief would steal next, and let him marry his daughter."

As the sea became more and more threatening, the king finally agreed.
On his return to his kingdom, he found his first son had been born and he told the queen what he had promised. They raised their son and when the youth was 16, the king and queen decided to have him leave home so the mermaid would not be able to find him when she came to collect on the promise. The king and queen sent the prince out into the world.
On his first night, the young prince met a hungry lion and shared his food with the beast; the lion repaid the kindness by giving him the tip of its ear and told him this gift would help him transform himself into a lion if he so wished. The prince turned himself into a lion the following day and traveled that way until he tired of it and turned himself back into a man. That night, the same thing happened with a bear asking for food and repaying the kindness with the tip of his ear that would turn the prince into a bear if he so wished. The following day, after he shared his food with a bumblebee he was given a hair from its wing that would transform the prince into a bee so he could fly all day without tiring.
The prince continued his adventure and arrived at a city where there lived a young princess who hated all men and would not permit one in her presence.  When everyone had retired for the night, the prince turned himself into a bee and flew into the princess's room.  He turned himself back into a man and the princess shrieked, but when the guards ran in to protect her they found nothing, so they left.

So when the prince once more became a man, the guards did not respond to the princess's cries.
The prince wooed the princess and she fell in love with him.  She told him that in three days, her father would go to war and leave his sword behind. Whoever brought it to him would gain her hand.  He agreed to do so, and told her if he did not return, she should play a violin on the seashore loudly enough to reach the bottom of the sea.
The prince left for war with the king, and when the king discovered he had not brought his sword, he promised his entourage that whoever brought his sword back to him would have the hand of the princess and would inherit the throne. The young prince and other knights took off for the city to retrieve the sword, The prince got ahead by frightening off the other knights by transforming himself into a lion.

The Red Knight found the sword and carried it off to the king to claim his prize.
Soon the war was over, and the king returned to his kingdom and told the princess she must marry the Red Knight.  During the wedding feast, the princess, recalling what the prince had told her, went to the shore and played her violin. The mermaid heard her song but the prince claimed not to hear it and asked the mermaid to raise him higher and higher in the sea so he could hear.  On reaching   the surface, the prince transformed himself into a bee and flew to the princess who carried him away.
The princess brought the prince to the feast and challenged the Red Knight to turn himself into a lion, a bear, and a bee, at all three of which he failed. She then asked the prince to do so and he did all three.  The princess told her father that it was the prince who retrieved the sword and showed him their matching rings.

This collection of fairy tales originally published in 1880. Mary de Morgan helped to make the Victorian era prominent in literature. In her short stories, she is able to use ""mystery, pathos, and comedy"" to create entertaining and imaginative literature for all to enjoy. In addition, de Morgan uses both female and male protagonists in her writing exhibiting her belief in equality among the sexes. In many of her works, Mary de Morgan uses elements from the folk tales of medieval England.
This is apparent in the universality of her literature, as it was easily relatable to all in Victorian England despite the different socioeconomic classes.The fairy tale of ""The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde"" is about a young wicked princess named Fiorimonde. With the help of a witch, Fiorimonde uses magic to maintain her beauty. When the King wishes her to marry, Fiorimonde, not wishing her suitors to discover her secret, transforms them into beautiful beads on a necklace. Her maid Yolande, and a friend of one of the suitors, learn of the Princess' wickedness and wish to free her suitors from her curse. She is only defeated when she herself is transformed into a bead on the necklace.

","Fiorimonde is a beautiful princess whose father is a powerful yet kind king. The princess is unlike any woman on Earth, she has long golden locks, the fairest of skin, and big beautiful eyes. In spite of her beauty, however, Princess Fiorimonde is a wicked princess, who practices black magic and witchcraft. Every night, while the rest of the castle sleeps, Princess Fiorimonde travels to a small hut on the side of a mountain where an old and ugly witch teaches her sorcery. It is in fact by the Witch's magic that the princess grows more beautiful with each passing day. 
As she grows older, the princess's widowed father, with no male heir to his throne, decides it is time for the princess to marry. So, the King and his council sends out summons to neighboring kingdoms stating that the King will choose a suitable husband for the Princess who will then become King after his death. Hearing this, the Princess knows that should she be wed, her husband will discover her secret that she visits the witch each night and will force her to stop practicing magic, which will cause her to lose her beauty. 
That night, the princess goes to the old Witch's hut and asks for advice. The witch gives the princess three choices: to turn her suitors into dogs to come whenever the princess calls, to turn them into birds and have them fly into the air and sing of her beauty, or to turn them into the beads of a necklace so beautiful that no woman has ever worn anything like its equal. Of these, the Princess contently chooses the last. The witch, before giving the Princess the strongest gold thread upon which the beads will rest, warns the princess that should she wrap her fingers around the thread, she too will become a bead until the gold thread is cut and her bead is taken off the thread.  Heeding the witch's warning, the Princess takes the golden thread and returns home.
The next day, the king announces that King Pierrot has come to marry his daughter. Almost as soon as the king announces this, the Princess has King Pierrot wrap his fingers around her gold thread and he becomes a beautiful bead on the necklace. The princess mourns for a month at the ""disappearance"" of King Pierrot. More suitors continue to come to ask for the Princess's hand in marriage, and the Princess continues to trick them into touching her necklace and to become beads. Each time a suitor disappears, Yolande, the princess's maid notices a new bead appears on the Princess's gold thread. 
One day, after many suitors have come and gone, Prince Florestan tries his luck with the Princess, despite the warnings of his friend Gervaise that all who go to marry Princess Fiorimonde go missing. Upon arriving at the court, Prince Florestan is welcomed humbly by the King. Later, just as all the rest have gone missing, so too does Prince Florestan. Gervaise however, is told by the Princess's maid, Yolande, of the Princess's sorcery. That night, in an effort to save Prince Florestan and the others, Gervaise and Yolande go to cut the thread from the sleeping Princess's neck. However, Yolande herself becomes a bead in the process. 
A few days later, Gervaise returns to Princess Fiorimonde's palace so well disguised as a Prince that the Princess does not even recognize him. Upon arrival, Gervaise begins to provoke the Princess by saying that he has seen a more beautiful woman than her. Angered, the Princess asks Gervaise to bring this woman to her. Cunningly, Gervaise says that he will only bring the woman to the Princess if she gives him her necklace. Outraged, the Princess refuses, and that night she travels to the Witch's hut to ask for her help. The witch advises the Princess not to listen to this Prince's lies and to be careful unless she wants to become a bead on her necklace herself. 
The next morning as the sun rises, Gervaise goes into the woods. There, he plucks acorns, haws, and hips and creates a necklace of his own and he hides it in his bosom. He then returns to the palace with no one knowing of his absence. Later that morning, the Princess calls Gervaise into her company.  The Princess, upon his arrival, asks him again if she is the most beautiful woman on earth and again he replies her saying that he has managed to find another more beautiful. Remembering the witch's warning, the Princess then asks Gervaise if he has seen a more beautiful necklace than hers. He responds cunningly that he has never seen such a beautiful necklace; however, he prefers another, which is the one he had strung together earlier from the haws and acorns. Fiorimonde greedily wants to see the necklace that Gervaise claims to be better than hers and she believes that perhaps Gervaise's necklace has powers to make the wearer beautiful and that is why he had seen a more beautiful woman than her. Gervaise agrees to make an exchange for his necklace and he tells her to take off hers. In her anger, the Princess attempts to take off her necklace, not realizing her mistake. She disappears and becomes the thirteenth bead on the golden thread. Gervaise, in his delight, picks up the necklace with the tip of his sword and brings it to the King. 
Gervaise then cuts the golden thread and removes each bead on the necklace at a time, which allows for the returning Princes to tell their stories to the King. Therefore, this proves the wickedness of the princess. Finally, Gervaise removes the beads that are Yolande and his dear friend Prince Florestan. In his humility, the King asks how he can ever repay Gervaise and the other Princes who have been subject to his daughters' cruelty. Gervaise only requests that the bead representing Princess Fiorimonde never be removed from the gold thread, and that the necklace be hung as a warning for others who are as wicked as she is.

the_nettle_spinner,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nettle_Spinner,The Nettle Spinner,"The Nettle Spinner is a Flemish and French fairy tale collected by Charles Deulin in Contes du roi Cambrinus under the title La Fileuse d'orties.  Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A great lord was so cruel to his peasants that they called him Burchard the Wolf.  His wife was kind and generous, and would secretly do good for those whom her husband wronged.  
One day Burchard saw a peasant woman named Renelde.  He told her if she came to the castle, he would make her the countess's lady-maid.  She refused because she had to look after her grandmother, and was betrothed to a huntsman named Guilbert.  He returned again, offering to make her a lady-in-waiting, and then to dismiss the countess and marry her.  The last offer would not have moved her even if she had wanted to be the countess, because the countess had helped her when her grandmother was ill.
Some time later, he saw her spinning flax, and asked what she was about.  She told him she was making her wedding shift, as she was to be married, if he gave his leave.  He told her that she must spin nettles instead, to make her shift and his shroud, because she would not marry until he was laid in his grave.  Guilbert offered to kill the count.  Renelde refused because it would be murder, and besides, the countess had been kind to her.  Her grandmother suggested that she try spinning the nettles. 
She found she could make good thread of them, and when Burchard came by again, she showed him her shift.  She began on the shroud, and Burchard felt ill that evening.  He sent soldiers to throw her into the river, but she struggled to shore and went on spinning.  When they tried to tie a stone to her neck, it untied itself, and she made to shore.  The Count had himself carried to the cottage—he was too ill to walk—and tried to shoot her, but the bullet rebounded harmlessly.  He broke the spinning wheel, but it was repaired the next day.  He had her tied and set guards, but the guards fell asleep and the bonds untied themselves.  He had every nettle uprooted, but they instantly sprouted again, even in her cottage.  Every day the Count grew worse, and the Countess found out why.  She asked Renelde to stop, and she did.  
The count recovered but still refused Renelde permission to marry Guilbert.  After a year, Guilbert left.  Another year went by, and Burchard fell ill again, though Renelde had not started spinning again.  He grew worse and worse and longed for death, but could not die.  Then he realized that his shroud was not ready.  He sent word to Renelde to prepare it.  His pains grew less as she spun, wove, and sewed.  When she took the last stitch he died.
Soon after this, Guilbert returned.  He still loved Renelde and married her."

","An emperor's golden apple tree was robbed every night, and his sons set themselves to watch it. The older two slept, but the youngest stayed awake. Nine peahens arrived. Eight rifled the tree, while the ninth came down beside him and became a beautiful maiden. She talked with him. He begged her to leave one apple, and she left two. This went on for two nights, until his brothers spied on him and saw how it happened. They made a bargain with a witch, and the next night she leapt up and cut off a lock of the maiden's hair. The prince caught the witch and had her executed, but the peahens did not return.
Grieving, the prince set out in search of his beloved. He found a castle with an aging empress, who had one daughter. On hearing that nine peahens bathed in the lake outside, he set out, despite her efforts to have him stay. The empress bribed his servant to blow a whistle when the nine peahens approached. This threw him into an enchanted sleep. The ninth tried to wake him, but to no avail. She told the servant they would come on the next day and never again. The next day, the servant put him to sleep again, and the maiden told him that if the prince wanted to find her, he should roll the under peg on the upper. The servant repeated this to the prince.  The prince cut off his head and went on alone.
A hermit directed him to a castle, he found the ninth peahen, and they were married at once. One day his wife, the empress, had to go on journey, and forbade him to go into the twelfth cellar. When he went in, a cask with iron bands about it asked him for water.  He gave it three cups. It burst, and a dragon sprang out to fly off and capture the empress.
He set out in search of her.  He saw a fish on the bank, helped it into the water, and received a scale to call it; a fox in a trap, and received a couple of hairs; and a wolf in another trap, and received a couple of hairs. He found where the empress was held captive, and they tried to escape. The dragon saw them and wanted to pursue them, but his horse told him there was plenty of time to eat and drink before setting off and, sure enough, after he had eaten and drunk, the dragon captured them. He let the prince go because of the drinks of water, but promised it would be the only clemency.
The prince returned to the castle and had the empress ask the dragon where he got the horse. The dragon related how a witch had a mare and foal, and that whoever watched over these for her for three days would get his pick of her horses, but that whoever failed in the task would lose his life. The prince travelled to the witch's house and noticed that, all around it poles had been set up, all but one of which had a skull upon it. She hired him to look after the horses. He watched all day, but fell asleep during the night - whereupon they escaped into the water. Using the scale he had been given, the prince summoned the fish, who told him the charm with which to get them out. When he went back for dinner, the witch scolded the horse, listened to the excuse it gave for being recaptured by the prince and told it to try going among the foxes on the morrow. The next day the prince used the fox hairs to summon the fox to retrieve the mare and foal, and, the day after that, the wolf hairs to call the wolf to retrieve them from among the wolves.
When, at last, the prince came to claim his reward, he asked for the ugly horse in the corner and would not be dissuaded from his choice, but straightway hastened back to the castle on his new steed and carried off the empress.  When the dragon saw this, he asked his horse whether he had time to eat and drink before setting off in pursuit, but the horse said he would not catch the fugitives, regardless of whether he ate first or set off straight away. Undaunted, the dragon set off anyway and, during the pursuit, the dragon's horse complained to the prince's of the effort involved in trying to catch him. The prince's horse asked the dragon's horse why it put up with it - whereupon the dragon's horse threw the dragon and killed him, and the empress rode it the rest of the way home."

","A poor miller and his wife are at risk of losing their mill which is their livelihood. One day while passing by the mill pond, a beautiful water spirit, known as a nixie, rises from the water and calls out to the miller by name. Initially intimidated, the miller eventually confides in the nixie about his financial troubles. The nixie offers him wealth in exchange for what was born in his house that morning. The miller assumes that he was only at risk of losing a pet such as a young puppy or a kitten and therefore agrees to the deal.
The miller returning to his home is surprised to find that his wife had unexpectedly given birth to a baby boy. Horrified, the miller realizes that the nixie was aware of his son's birth when she offered him the deal; both he and his wife are unsure of what to do. The years pass and both the miller's fortune and son grow. Despite this success, the miller remains worried about the nixie collecting payment and warns his son of danger near the mill pond.
The boy grows into a skilled hunter and marries a woman from the local village. One day, while hunting near the mill pond, he shoots and dresses a deer. He goes to the mill pond to wash off the blood and suddenly the nixie appears to pull him under the water.
When he did not return home at night, his wife went to search for him, suspecting that the nixie was responsible for his disappearance. She approaches the pond and calls out to her husband and the nixie, but there is no sign of him. Distraught, she falls asleep at the water's edge and dreams of climbing up a perilous cliff side, reaching the top and finding a cottage with an old woman inside. When she awakes the next day, the woman re-enacts the scene of climbing the cliff from her dream. Upon reaching the old woman, she is given a golden comb and instructions to comb her hair by the pond during the full moon and to set it by the banks once she is finished. Once she sets down the comb, her husband's head rises above the water for a brief moment, looking sorrowful before a wave comes and drags him under again.
Unsatisfied by only having a glimpse of her husband, the woman returns to the cottage for a second time. She is given a golden flute and told to play a beautiful tune under the full moon at the mill pond and afterward to place the flute in the sand. This time, after completing the task, her husband partially rises from the water and reaches towards her, but once again a wave pulls him under.
The woman returns to the cottage for a third time and receives a golden spinning wheel and instructions to spin flax under the full moon until she had a full spool to place on the bank. Following these instructions, her husband once again appears, but this time he is able to break free from the pond. The enraged nixie unleashes a massive wave from the pond to try drag the couple under as they ran away. Before they can be killed by the nixie's pond, the woman begs for the old woman of the cottage to help them. The woman is transformed into a toad and her husband into a frog. While saved from death, the flood takes them far from their native land and separates the couple by a distance of mountains and valleys. When the water recedes, although their human forms have return, neither knows where the other is. Both take up work as shepherds to survive, but they are filled with sorrow and longing for one another.
Years pass and one spring the man and woman meet each other while tending their flocks, but they do not immediately recognize the other. One night under the full moon, the man plays the same tune on a flute as the woman once played at the mill pond. The woman starts to cry and tells him of the story of her lost husband. Suddenly, they both recognize each other. They embrace and kiss and live happily ever after."

","The King is unable to destroy the Norka, a huge beast who is devouring his animals. He offers half his kingdom to any one of his sons who kills the Norka. The two eldest sons drink and revel instead of hunting the beast. The youngest third son, a simpleton, wounds and chases the beast. The beast escapes under a great stone. The third son descends to the underworld and meets a talking horse who calls him Ivan and takes him to a copper palace owned by a beautiful woman, a sister of the Norka. He travels to a silver palace and a golden palace, also owned by the sisters of the Norka. The third and youngest sister tells him that Norka is asleep on the sea. She gives him a sword and the Water of Strength, and tells him to cut off her brother's head with a single stroke. He cuts off the Norka's head, which says ""Well, I'm done for now!"", and rolls into the sea.
The three sisters are in love with him, so he takes them with him to the surface world. They change their palaces into eggs with magic, teach him how to do it, and give him the eggs. His brothers pull the three maidens up, but try to kill the third son by cutting the rope halfway up. He substituted a stone for himself, however, so he was not killed. Stranded in the underworld, he sadly wandered away as it rains. He covers some baby birds with his coat to protect them from the rain. The giant mother bird is grateful and carries him to the surface.
A tailor tells him that the two princes are going to marry the maidens from the underworld, but the maidens refuse to be married until wedding dresses are made in the underworld style, and without measuring them. The third son tells the tailor to accept the job to make the clothes for the wedding. At night, the third son turns the eggs into palaces, takes the maiden's clothes from the palaces, and turns the palaces into eggs again. He gives the dresses to the tailor who is paid richly by the King. He visits the shoemaker and other artificers and does the same thing. The youngest maiden recognizes him (in rags), grabs him, and takes him to the palace. She explains to the king what happened and that the brothers threatened to kill them if they said the third son was alive. The King punishes the two brothers. Three weddings are celebrated."

Andrew Lang included it in The Violet Fairy Book (1901).It is Aarne-Thompson type 550, the quest for the golden bird/firebird.

","A Sultan was very proud of his garden and of six of his seven sons, but he scorned the youngest son as weak.  One day, he saw that his date tree was ready to fruit; he sent his oldest sons to watch it, or the slaves would steal the fruit and he would have none for many a year.  The son had his slaves beat drums to keep him awake, but when it grew light they slept and a bird ate all the dates.  Every year after that, he set a different son and finally two sons but for five years the bird ate the dates.  The sixth year, he sent a man of his. His youngest son asked why he did not send him.  Finally the father agreed. The youngest went, sent his slaves home and slept until early. Then he sat with corn in one hand and sand in the other.  He chewed on the corn until he grew sleepy and then he put sand in his mouth, which kept him awake.

The bird arrived.  He grabbed it.  It flew off with him, but he did not let go, even when it threatened him. In return for its freedom, the bird gave him a feather and said if the son put it in a fire, the bird would come wherever he was. The son returned, and the dates were still there. There was much rejoicing.
One day, the sultan's cat caught a calf and the sultan refused compensation on the grounds that technically he owned both. The next day it caught a cow, and then a donkey, a horse, and a child and then a man. Finally it lived in a thicket and ate whatever went by but the sultan would still not entertain any complaints. One day, the sultan went out to see the harvest with his six sons and the cat sprang out and killed three. The sultan demanded its death, admitting it was a demon.
Against his desperate parent's wishes, the youngest son set out after the cat, which was called ""The Nunda (Eater of People)"" and could not find it for many days. Finally, he and his slaves tracked it over a mountain, through a great forest. The prince and slaves threw spears into it and ran away. The next day they carried it back to the town. The people and Sultan rejoiced because they had been delivered from the bondage of fear."
the_nutcracker_and_the_mouse_king,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker_and_the_Mouse_King,The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,"""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" (German: Nussknacker und Mausekönig) is a story written in 1816 by Prussian author E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which young Marie Stahlbaum's favorite Christmas toy, the Nutcracker, comes alive and, after defeating the evil Mouse King in battle, whisks her away to a magical kingdom populated by dolls. The story was originally published in Berlin in German as part of the collection Kinder-Mährchen, Children's Stories, by In der Realschulbuchhandlung. In 1892, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov turned Alexandre Dumas' adaptation of the story into the ballet The Nutcracker.

","The story begins on Christmas Eve, at the Stahlbaum house. Marie, seven, and her brother, Fritz, sit outside the parlor speculating about what kind of present their godfather, Drosselmeyer, a clockmaker and inventor, has made for them. They receive splendid gifts; Drosselmeyer's turns out to be a clockwork castle with mechanical people moving around inside. However, the children quickly tire of it. Marie notices a nutcracker, and asks whom he belongs to. Her father tells her that he belongs to all of them, but that since she is so fond of him she will be his special caretaker. She, Fritz, and their sister, Louise, pass him amongst themselves, cracking nuts, until Fritz tries to crack one that is too big and hard, and his jaw breaks. Marie, upset, bandages him with a ribbon from her dress.
When it is time for bed, the children put their Christmas gifts away in the special cabinet where they keep their toys. Marie begs to stay with the nutcracker a while longer, and she is allowed. She tells him that Drosselmeyer will fix his jaw. At this, his face seems to come alive, and Marie is frightened, but decides it was her imagination.

The grandfather clock begins to chime, and Marie believes she sees Drosselmeyer sitting on top of it, preventing it from striking. Mice begin to come out from beneath the floorboards, including the seven-headed Mouse King. The dolls in the toy cabinet come alive, the nutcracker taking command and leading them into battle after putting Marie's ribbon on. The dolls are overwhelmed by the mice. Marie, seeing the nutcracker about to be taken prisoner, throws her slipper at the Mouse King. She then faints into the toy cabinet's glass door, cutting her arm.
Marie wakes up in her bed the next morning with her arm bandaged and tries to tell her parents about the battle between the mice and dolls, but they do not believe her. Several days later, Drosselmeyer arrives with the nutcracker, whose jaw has been fixed, and tells Marie the story of Princess Pirlipat and Madam Mouserinks, known as the Queen of the Mice, which explains how nutcrackers came to be and why they look the way they do.
The Mouse Queen tricked Pirlipat's mother into allowing her and her children to gobble up the lard that was supposed to go into the sausage that the King was to eat at dinner. The King, enraged at the Mouse Queen for spoiling his supper and upsetting his wife, had his court inventor, also named Drosselmeyer, create traps for the Mouse Queen and her children. 
The Mouse Queen, angered at the death of her children, swore that she would take revenge on Pirlipat. Pirlipat's mother surrounded her with cats which were supposed to be kept awake by being constantly stroked, however the nurses who did so fell asleep and the Mouse Queen magically turned Pirlipat ugly, giving her a huge head, a wide grinning mouth, and a cottony beard like a nutcracker. The King blamed Drosselmeyer and gave him four weeks to find a cure. He went to his friend, the court astrologer. 
They read Pirlipat's horoscope and told the King the only way to cure her was to have her eat the nut Crackatook (Krakatuk), which must be cracked and handed to her by a man who had never been shaved nor worn boots since birth, and who must, without opening his eyes, hand her the kernel and take seven steps backwards without stumbling. The King sent Drosselmeyer and the astrologer out to look for both. 
The two men journeyed for many years without finding either the nut or the man, until finally they returned home to Nuremberg and found the nut with Drosselmeyer's cousin, a puppet-maker. His son turned out to be the young man needed to crack the nut Crackatook. The King promised Pirlipat's hand to whoever could crack the nut. Many men broke their teeth on it before Drosselmeyer's nephew cracked it easily and handed it to Pirlipat, who swallowed it and immediately became beautiful again. But Drosselmeyer's nephew, on his seventh backward step, stepped on the Mouse Queen and stumbled, and the curse fell on him, giving him a large head, wide mouth, and cottony beard; making him a nutcracker. The ungrateful and unsympathetic Pirlipat, seeing how ugly he had become, refused to marry him and banished him from the castle.

Marie, while she recuperates from her wound, hears the Mouse King, son of the deceased Madam Mouserinks, whispering to her in the middle of the night, threatening to bite the nutcracker to pieces unless she gives him her sweets and dolls. She sacrifices them, but he wants more and more. Finally, the nutcracker tells her that if she gets him a sword, he will kill the Mouse King. Fritz gives her the one from his toy hussars. The next night, the nutcracker comes into Marie's room bearing the Mouse King's seven crowns, and takes her to the doll kingdom, where she sees wonderful things. She falls asleep in the nutcracker's palace and is brought home. She tries to tell her mother what happened, but again she is not believed, even when she shows her parents the seven crowns, and is forbidden to speak of her ""dreams"" anymore. 
Marie sits in front of the toy cabinet one day while Drosselmeyer is repairing one of her father's clocks. She swears to him that if he were ever really real she would never behave as Pirlipat did, and would love him whatever he looked like. At this, there is a bang and she faints and falls off the chair. Her mother comes in to tell her that Drosselmeyer's nephew has arrived from Nuremberg. He tells her that by swearing that she would love him in spite of his looks, she broke the curse and made him human again. He asks her to marry him. She accepts, and in a year and a day he comes for her and takes her away to the doll kingdom, where she is crowned queen."
the_old_dame_and_her_hen,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Dame_and_Her_Hen,The Old Dame and her Hen,"""The Old Dame and her Hen"" is the English title given by Dasent to the Norwegian folk tale, Asbjørnsen and Moe’s number 35.
The tale's original title, ""Høna tripper i berget"" is more accurately rendered ""The Hen is Tripping in the Mountain"", as given in Reidar Thoralf Christiansen's translation.The tale is categorized as Aarne-Thompson type 311, ""Rescue by the Sister.""

","An old widow had three daughters, and only one hen for livestock.  The hen had gone missing, and the widow she sent her eldest to find it, even if she had to go out in the hill above where they lived. After searching far and wide without success, the girl heard a voice call from a cleft in the rock:

and when she investigated, she stepped on a trap-door and fell underground.  She went through a series of rooms, each room ever increasingly finer-looking as she proceeded, until in the innermost chamber she encountered a hideous-looking ""man of the hill-folk"" or ""Man o' the Hill"" (old spelling: Bjergmand; modern Bokmål/Nynorsk: bergmann), also later on referred to as  ""the troll"" (Troldet).The troll asked her to be his sweetheart, and when she declined, he angrily wrung her head off.  The middle daughter was sent out to look for her sister and the hen, but met the same fate. The youngest daughter too fell down the chute, but prudently did some exploring, so that when she opened the hatch-door to the cellar she discovered her dead sisters inside. Since she deduced what befell her sisters, when asked by the troll to be his sweetheart, she pretended to agree wholeheartedly.
Though she was furnished with fine clothing and anything else she desired, she proclaimed one day that she worried for her mother, who must be hungry and thirsty, with no one else there to attend to her.  The troll would not allow her to go home, but if wanted, she could fill a sack with food, which he would carry to her mother.  The youngest daughter stuffed the sack with gold and silver and put a little food on top to camouflage it.  She forbade him to look inside along the way. After while, his load felt so heavy he was tempted to look, but she shouted after him that she saw what he was doing.

It so happened that a billy goat fell into the hill, and the troll wrung the head off the ""shaggy beast"".  When the youngest daughter complained that the animal could have kept her company, the troll took a crock (krukke) from the wall, smeared its content on the goat's wound to put the head back on the body, bringing it back to life.
The youngest sister awaited opportunity, and when the troll was away from home, used the crock to restore life to her oldest sister. Concealing the revived sister inside the sack, camouflaged with food on top, the youngest told the troll to carry that sack again to her mother, making him promise never to peek inside. When the troll did try to sneak a look, he heard a voice shout ""I see what you're at!"", prompting the baffled troll to answer ""You've got one devil of a pair of eyes"". The voice actually came from the sister he was carrying in the sack, but he mistook it for his sweetheart shouting. The youngest made the troll carry the middle sister the same way, except it was a great deal heavier this time because she stuffed the sack with gold and silver as well.

The youngest then devised a scheme to make her own getaway. She gained more time by feigning sickness and telling him it was no use coming back until twelve midnight, because she will not have his dinner ready before then.  Then she stuffed straw into her clothes, and propped up the figure by the hearth, making the dummy look like it was holding a stirring-stick (tvare, pictured right) in its hand. She then ran back home to her mother, and had a sharpshooter to stay with them.  The troll came back to his home demanded his supper; when the straw-woman did not answer, he struck and realized what had happened; then he saw the bodies of her sisters were missing as well.  Raging, he came after them, but the sharp shooter scared him off.  He went back, but just as he was to go below ground, the sun rose, and he shattered into bits."

The old woman was quite angry, but the girl did not heed her. Then, when she could not see the plain ring, she saw the old woman trying to carry off a bird cage. She took it away from her. It held a bird, which held the ring in its beak, so she took it outside and waited against a tree. Two branches turned into arms about her as the tree turned into a handsome man who kissed her. He told her that the old woman was a witch who had turned him into a tree, and for two hours a day, he became a dove, and she had freed him. All his attendants turned back from trees to humans as well. With the prince being a king's son, they went to his father's kingdom and got married."

","A dying man asked his children which they would have:  his property or his blessing.  His son wanted his property, and his daughter his blessing.  He died.  Soon after, his wife died as well, and again, the son wanted her property and the daughter her blessing.  She died.  The brother left his sister only a pot and a vessel, but people borrowed her pot and gave her corn for it, so the sister survived.  One day, she had a pumpkin seed and planted it, and then had pumpkins as well.  Her brother, envious, stole her pot and mortar, but she was able to replace them by selling her pumpkins.  Her brother's wife sent a slave to buy one, and the sister gave her one for free, though there were few left, so the wife sent another slave, and this one the sister had to send away, because there were none left.  The wife wept and told the brother that his sister would sell pumpkins to other people but not to her.  Enraged, the brother went to cut the sister's pumpkin patch down.  His sister told him that if he did, he would cut off her hand with it, but putting her hand on it did her no good:  he cut it off while chopping down the vines.  Then he sold the house she lived in.
The sister wandered about, sleeping every night in trees.  One day, a king's son rested under the tree where she rested, and was woken by her tears.  He married her.  She had a baby, in bed. Her brother had lost all his wealth, and came by that city.  Hearing of the woman who had lost one hand but married the prince, he knew she was his sister.  He persuaded her husband's parents that she was a witch whose hand had been cut off in punishment.  They would not kill her, but put her out with her child.  She left with only an earthen pot to cook in.  In the woods, a snake asked her to hide it in the pot from a larger snake.  When she did, it told her to bathe in a certain pond.  She did, and lost her baby in the waters.  The snake told her to feel for him with both hands; she found him again, and her lost hand was restored.  Then it took her home to its parents, who were grateful to her for saving it.  Meanwhile, her brother rose high in the king's favor.
The prince had fallen ill on his journey, so that his parents did not know him when he returned until he spoke.  Then they were glad, but told him that his wife and child were dead.
One day, the sister said that she had to go see her husband.  At the snake's suggestions, she asked its father for a ring, and its mother for a casket.  They told her that the ring would give her food, clothing, and shelter, and the casket would protect her from harm.  Near the town where her husband and his father lived, she used the ring to make herself a house to live.  The king heard of it and brought his son and ministers, including the brother, to see who lived there.  She told them her story.  Her husband recognized her and took her back, and her brother was thrown out of town."

Then the king died, and the queen was so grief-stricken she knew she would die.  She sent for a fairy to watch over the princess.  The fairy promised to act as regent but warned her that the princess's fate would be hard.  After the queen died, she learned the princess was threatened with the love of a giant; if she was kept safe until sixteen, she would be safe, but if she saw the giant before then, her fate would be hard.  So she decreed wise laws and bore the princess off to an Arcadia, where she was raised as a shepherdess.  She had one sheep she particularly loved; she named it Ruson, and it could obey her commands, although it loved a ewe more than her.  One day she saw a wolf carrying Ruson off and chased after; this brought her in sight of the giant, who instantly fell in love with her.   He carried her off in his wallet, along with Ruson and the wolf and other creatures.  They made such a noise that the giant hung the wallet on a tree to be rid of it.  Constancia cut it open and let herself and all the creatures but the wolf out.  She found herself in a dark forest with no clear way; she would have died if the animals had not helped her.  But finally she came to a river and found herself alone with Ruson.  
A prince, Constancio, found her there, and she implored a job as a shepherdess.  His mother the queen was unhappy with an old shepherdess, and Constancio got the job for Constancia.  Constancio was deeply distressed, because he had never been in love before, and Constancia was far too lowly in birth for him to marry; he heard her singing of love, she would not tell him who she sang of, and his jealousy made his love more fierce.  He set a servant, Mirtain, to spy on her, but when Mirtain assured him that she could not be in love with any shepherd, he did not believe him.  He took ill, and Mirtain implored Constancia to come to the castle and heal him.  She did not go, but Mirtain told the queen, who ordered her to come and threatened to drown her if the prince died.  She came and confessed to the prince that her skills were not great, but the prince recovered.  She was taken on as a gardener for the flowers, but the king dreamed that she would marry their son.  His orders to send the girl back to the sheep annoyed the queen, and instead, she set out to find out how their son felt toward Constancia.  She learned they were in love, and ordered him to go visit her brother; they had arranged to him to marry a princess there, and they should meet first.  Constancio said he should not let his heart interfere, since it was a marriage of state.  The queen ordered him to go, or she would kill Constancia. 
Constancio found Constancia and told her he would go and try to persuade his uncle and the bride that he was unsuitable.  He left.  His mother intercepted his letters and found him confiding in Mirtain, whom she immediately imprisoned on a false charge.  One day, Constancia found the garden filled with poisonous creatures, from which she was protected only by the ring the prince had given her.  When that failed, the queen sent her to get the girdle of affection from a fairy whose home was unreachable, because of the elephants she kept in the forest, but Constancia had heard from an old shepherd that the sight of a lamb made the elephants gentle, and that the girdle would burn up when she left, so she should tie it about trees.  She set out with Ruson, and the elephants were gentle.  The fairy gave her the girdle, and when she left, Constancia tied it around a tree, which it burned up rather than her.  She brought it to the queen, who asked why she had not put it on; she said it was not suitable for her.  The queen insisted, but it had already expended its fire.  The queen sold her as a slave to a merchant about to sail.
Constancio had been very rude to his intended bride.  When he received word that Constancia was ill, he set out, and when he arrived, he was told she was dead.  He fell deathly ill and told his mother of Constancia's royal birth.  The queen told him the truth to save him, and Mirtain assured him it was true.  Constancio set out to find her.  He implored help from some giants, who did not answer, but Cupid himself came and said he must aid him:  if Constancio cast himself in a fire, he could reach her, but if his love was not true, he would die.  Constancio threw himself in and found himself in a garden, and transformed into a pigeon.  He remembered the tale of the Blue Bird (another fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy), tried to kill himself, and heard that Constancia was a prisoner in a tower.  He was captured and brought to the fairy whose care Constancia had been left in.  She told him the ship had brought Constancia into the giant's power.  She gave him a ring that would turn her into a dove, and he brought it to Constancia.  They flew off, the giant drowned himself in despair, and the fairy and Cupid gave the couple a secret home where they could live."

","A childless queen prayed for a child.  An angel told her she would have a son with the power of wishing.  She had such a son, and every day went with the child to a park where wild beasts were kept.  There she washed herself in a stream.  One day, a cook stole the child and stained the queen's clothing with hen's blood; then he accused the queen of having let the child be eaten.  The queen was imprisoned in a tower to starve, but angels were sent to feed her.
The cook, afraid of being caught, had the prince wish for a castle and a little girl as a companion; they lived there, but the cook grew afraid that the boy would wish for his father and reveal his crime, and told the girl, who had grown to a maiden, that she must murder the boy while he slept and cut out his heart and tongue. The girl refused to murder someone so innocent, but the cook threatened to kill her the next day if she didn't obey. She killed a hind and cut out its heart and tongue; then she had the boy hide in the bed.  The cook asked about the murder, and the boy got out of the bed and turned him into a poodle for his betrayal.
The boy wished to go home. The girl was frightened at the thought of the journey, so the boy turned her into a pink (or carnation) and went home, with the poodle running after and the pink in his pocket.  He went to his mother, who at first took him for the angels who fed her; he assured her he would free her. Then he worked as a huntsman for his own father.  He hunted so much game that the king insisted that the huntsman sit by him at the feast. During the feast the boy reveals he is the king's son and that the cook was behind the evil plan all along. He changed the cook back into his own shape, and the king had him executed; he changed the pink back into the maiden, and because she had brought him up so tenderly and refused to murder him, the king sanctioned their marriage.
The queen was freed, but refused to eat, because angels, having supported her, would now deliver her. She died three days later, and the king died of grief, but the prince married the maiden and they ruled the kingdom together."

He was pleased with the third wife, but the other wives were jealous. When she bore a son, they claimed she had borne a lump of flesh; the first wife threw the baby into a pond, but he floated, and so the second wife had him wrapped in straw and grass and fed to a water buffalo.  When the official returned, his first wife gave him gold, the second silver, but when he heard that his third wife had borne a horrid lump of flesh, he sentenced her to grind rice in a mill.
The water buffalo gave birth to a beautiful calf with a hide like gold. It was fond of its master, who always gave it some of his food.

Andrew Lang included it in The Violet Fairy Book.

","A king's only son wanted to see the world and was so persistent that his father let him go. He played cards with a stranger and lost all his money; then the stranger offered to give it back on another game, but if the prince lost, he would have stay at the inn for three years and then be his servant for three years. The prince agreed and lost.
After three years at the inn, he went to the kingdom where the stranger, a king, lived. He met a woman with a child crying from hunger and gave the child his last bread and water. The mother told him to go to a garden, where there would be a tank. Three doves would bath there. He should grab the last one's robe of feathers and refuse to give it back until the dove gave him three things. He did as she said, and the dove gave him a ring, a collar, and one of her feathers, which could summon her. She told him that the king was her father, and hated his father, which was why he had made the prince lose.
When he arrived, the king gave him wheat, millet, and barley; he was to sow them, so that the king could have bread the next day. The prince summoned the dove, who sent him to bed. In the morning, he had the loaves of bread.  Then the king ordered him to find the ring his oldest daughter had lost in the sea.  The dove told him to take a basin and knife to the sea and set sail in a boat there. He did, and the dove was in the mast.  She told him to cut off her head and catch all the blood. When he did, a dove rose from the sea with the ring, and vanished.  The king then ordered him to break a colt.  The dove told him that the colt was the king, the saddle was her mother, her sisters the stirrups, and herself the bit; he should bring a club for such a ride. He did, and gave the colt such a beating that the royal family was all bruised afterward.
The dove told him it was time to flee because of their injuries, but he took the fattest, not the leanest, horse, which she had not told him to do, but there was no time to change. The queen, being a witch, realized that her youngest daughter had fled and sent the king to chase them. The dove made herself a nun, the prince a hermit, and the horse a cell. The hermit said they had seen no one.  The king went home. The queen told him that they were the run-away.  He chased them again, and the dove made the horse a plot, herself a rose-tree, and the prince a gardener.  The gardener told the king they had seen no one.  The king went home. The queen chased them herself. The dove made the horse a pool, herself an eel, and the prince a turtle; the queen caught the eel and told her husband to get some water from the pool for her spell.  The turtle made him spill it so he could not get any. The queen, defeated, cursed the dove so that the prince would forget her.
The dove was sad as they rode on. He left her at an inn so he could ask his father for leave to present her as his bride, but in his joy at seeing his family, he forgot her. She called on her sisters. They persuaded the innkeeper to sell them as doves to the prince. He was delighted with them, but they spoke to him, put the ring on his finger and the collar on his neck, and showed him the feather. He remembered and married her."
the_prince_and_the_princess_in_the_forest,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince_and_the_Princess_in_the_Forest,The Prince and the Princess in the Forest,"""The Prince and the Princess in the Forest"" is a Danish fairy tale collected by Evald Tang Kristensen (1843–1929) in Æventyr fra Jylland (Danish, ""Tales from Jutland"") in 1881. Andrew Lang included it in his The Olive Fairy Book (1907).

","After the king of Denmark dies, the queen is so inconsolable that her only child, the prince, suggests that they should go to a place on the other side of a forest. They become lost in the woods, but come upon two houses, the first containing a mail shirt and a sword, with a note that said they would keep a man safe from all danger, which the prince, unbeknownst to his mother, takes. The second house contains food and a bed (granting them both food and a place to sleep), but unfortunately it is a robber's den, and the next morning, when the prince is off hunting for the path, the queen is surprised by the robber chief, who tells her that if she wants to live, she must make him king in her husband's place and must kill her son. When the queen protests that she cannot do this, the robber chief tells her to pretend to be ill and send her son after some apples in a forest a mile away, knowing that the forest ""was full of wild animals who would tear to pieces any traveller who entered it.""
What happens next depends on the version of the story. One version says that the prince fights the forest creatures and wins; Lang's version, however, states that the forest ""was full of lions and tigers, and bears and wolves, who came rushing towards him; but instead of springing on him and tearing him to pieces, they lay down on the ground and licked his hands."" Once the creatures are no longer a threat, the prince finds the apple tree; when his sword brushes against it, two apples fall. After taking the apples, he starts to leave the wood, but a little black dog leads him to a tiny hole in the hill, which the sword enlarges enough for the prince to enter. A princess of Arabia is chained to an iron pillar within; twelve robbers had captured her and were fighting over who would marry her. She further says that she had been imprisoned there for twenty years. A touch of the prince's sword breaks the chain, and he leads her through the forest to a port containing a ship bound for Arabia, pledging that if he is still alive the following year, he will come to Arabia and wed her. She gives him a ring as a pledge of their promise, and sails home.
The robber smells the apples while the prince is still far away and, deciding that only powerful magic could have saved the prince from the animals, orders the queen to tell the prince that she had dreamed that he had been attacked by wild animals and to ask how he'd survived. The prince tells her about the magic mail shirt and magic sword, which the queen then tells the robber chief, who makes a sleeping draught for the prince and steals the sword and mail shirt, claiming they are his brother's. 
When he awakens, the robber gives him a choice: either die or be blinded and left in the forest. The prince, aware that his mother has betrayed him, chooses blindness. The robber and queen go back to Denmark, where they marry and the robber becomes king. 
The prince wanders until he arrives at the port, where there is a ship bound for Arabia. The captain, pitying the blind man, offers to take him to Arabia. Once there, the prince goes to the public baths, where the ring slips from his fingers; a slave finds it and brings it to a friend of his who lives in the palace, who recognizes it as the princess's ring. The friend passes it on to his daughter, who is the princess's favorite servant. The princess, on seeing it, identifies it as the ring of her betrothed, and, despite the objections of her father, who does not feel that a blind man can rule after him, the princess and the prince are married.
One day, the prince overhears two ravens saying that the dew that falls in a certain part of the garden on Midsummer's Eve restores sight to those with bad eyes, or even no eyes at all. The prince tries it, and finds, to his delight and that of the princess, that he can see once more.
As the princess falls asleep due to the heat, the prince sees, about her neck, a small shining lamp on a chain. The prince unfastens the chain to examine the lamp, but drops the lamp pendant, which is instantly snatched up by a hawk. The prince chases the hawk for so long that he ends up in the same woods as before.  When the princess wakes, she follows him and is captured by the same robbers.
The prince finds twelve youths seeking service.  He joins them, and they all go to work for a troll, who tells them they have to care for his house for a year and then answer three questions.  Those who succeed will receive a sack of gold; those who fail will be turned into beasts.
After a year, the prince heard the troll talking with another troll, saying he would ask how long they had been there (the twelve young men having been so busy partying that the troll was certain they did not know a year had passed), what shone on the roof (the lamp that the troll had stolen from the princess as she slept), and where their food came from (the king's table). When the troll asked these questions, the others did not know, but the prince answered all the questions correctly, so they all received their gold and left. On the way, they met an old beggar who asked for a piece of money for a poor man; the prince gave him his whole sackful. It was the troll in disguise, and he gave the prince the lamp he had stolen, telling him that the princess was in the same cave where the prince had found her.
The prince disguises himself as a peddler and then orders a great many pots and pans from a goldsmith, using them to distract his mother with them while he searches for and then reclaims the sword and mail shirt. When the robber chief returns, the prince strips him of his fine clothes and sends him into the forest, ""where the wild beasts tore him to pieces,"" and sent his mother back to her own country. He rescues his wife and they reign, for a long, long time, over both her country and his."

Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.,"A king and queen had lost all their children, and were most anxious about a daughter newly born to them.  The queen dismissed a hideous woman who put herself forth as a nurse, but every woman she hired was instantly killed.  The king realized that the ugly woman was the Fairy Carabosse, who had hated him since he played a prank on her as a child.  They tried to christen their daughter in secret, but Carabosse cursed her to be miserable her first twenty years.  The last fairy godmother could only promise that her life would be long and happy after those twenty years.  The eldest fairy advised that the princess be kept in a tower to minimize the harm.
When her twentieth year had nearly come, the king and queen sent her portrait about to princes.  One king sent his ambassador to make an offer for his son.  The princess conceived an overwhelming desire to see the ambassador, and her servants, for fear of what she would do, made a hole in the tower that let her see.  She instantly fell in love with the ambassador, Fanfarinet.  When she met him, she persuaded him to run away with her, and took the king's dagger and the queen's headdress with them.  They fled to a desert island.
The next morning, a chancellor realized how the princess had been looking at the ambassador, the nurses confessed about the hole, and the admiral set out in chase.  They identified the man who had rowed them to the island by the gold the princess had given them.
At the island, the ambassador instantly began to complain of hunger and thirst, and when the princess could find nothing, he could find nothing worthwhile in her love.  One day, a rose offered her some honeycomb and warned her not to show the ambassador; she did, and he snatched it and ate it all.  An oak offered her a pitcher of milk and warned her not to show the ambassador; she did, and he snatched it and drank it all.  The princess realized how rashly she had acted.  A nightingale offered her sugarplums and tarts, and this time, she ate them herself.  When the ambassador tried to threaten her, she used the magical stone in her mother's headdress to make herself invisible.
The admiral sent men to the island.  The princess used the magical stone to make the ambassador invisible, and he stabbed so many of them that they had to retreat.  But the hungry ambassador tried to kill her, and she killed him.  Two fairies fought, and one won and told her that the fairy Carabosse had tried to claim her because she left the tower four days before the twenty years were up, but she was defeated.  She is brought back to court, and the prince proved to be so much finer than his ambassador that she lived happily with him."

The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in an inexpensive booklet on 8 May 1835 in Copenhagen by C. A. Reitzel.
Andersen had heard the story as a child, and it likely has its source in folk material, possibly originating from Sweden, as it is unknown in the Danish oral tradition. Neither ""The Princess and the Pea"" nor Andersen's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics, who disliked their casual, chatty style and their lack of morals.The tale is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as ATU 704, ""The Princess and the Pea"".","The story tells of a prince who wants to marry a princess but is having difficulty finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets and he cannot be certain they are real princesses because they have bad table manners or they are not his type. One stormy night, a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She claims to be a princess, but no one is really believing her because of the way she looks, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and laid them upon the pea and placed twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.
In the morning, the princess tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by something hard in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. With the proof of her bruised back, the princess passes the test and the prince rejoices happily, for only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding. The two are happily married, and the story ends with the pea being placed in a museum, where, according to the story, it can still be seen today unless someone has stolen it."

","A king left his queen because they were childless and told her if she did not have a child by the time he returned, in a year, he would part with her.  An old woman advised her to eat a bud from a bush.  She would have a daughter.  The old woman would give her a nurse, who must raise the girl without anyone else seeing her until she was fourteen.  The queen did as she said, but when the fourteen years were one day short of complete, the king went to see her.  The princess said that now she would die.  The king had his choice of a pestilence, a long and bloody war, or putting her body in a wooden coffin and setting a sentinel over it every day for a year.  He did not believe it, but chose the coffin.  The next morning, she was dead.  He did as she directed, but every night, the sentinel vanished.  Soon, the story was that the princess's ghost ate whoever it was, and soldiers deserted rather than take on the duty.  The king got more by offering rewards, but no one ever received it.
One day, a smith named Christian came to the capital looking for work.  Soldiers got him to agree to the job, because he had gotten drunk. When the drink wore off, he tried to flee, but a little man stopped him and told him to stay in the pulpit until the coffin lid slammed.  He went into the pulpit, and at midnight, the princess came out and howled, demanding the sentinel.  She saw him in the pulpit but could not get up after him.  Finally, she had to go back to the coffin.
The next day, the king gave him a reward and a good meal, where he had plenty to drink, until the king offered twice the gold, and Christian agreed to stay the next night, too.  He tried to flee, and the little man stopped him again, telling him to stay in front of the altar and hold the prayer book there.  The princess rushed up to the pulpit that night; when she did not find him, she shrieked that war and pestilence would begin, but then she saw him and could not reach him.  She had to go back to the coffin, but she was less ugly that night than the one before.
The third day, Christian agreed when drunk again, but only for half the kingdom.  He tried to sneak off again, this time earlier to avoid the little man, and through a window.  The little man still stopped him, but this time he was to lie down by the coffin and climb inside as soon as she left it.  She came out at midnight and shrieked that war and pestilence would come.  She eventually found him in the coffin but was unable to reach him.  Despite her attempts to threaten and coax him out of the coffin, he did not move.  Then she went away and soft music came.  Christian heard a mass of thanksgiving being said for the deliverance.  At dawn he came out and found the princess alive.  She told him the curse was broken and if he agreed, they would marry. If not, she would go to a convent and he could never marry another as long as she lived (for the service he'd heard was a marriage ceremony of the dead).  Christian agreed to marry.  The king consented and made good on his promise to give Christian half his kingdom, eventually inheriting its entirety on the king's death."

The third, Boots also called Cinderlad, was despised by his brothers, who jeered at him for always sitting in the ashes, but he went the third year and stayed through three earthquakes.  At the end, he heard a horse and went outside to catch it eating the grass.  Next to it was a saddle, bridle, and full suit of armor, all in brass.  He threw the steel from his tinderbox over it, which tamed it.  When he returned home, he denied that anything had happened.  The next year, the equipment for the horse was in silver, and the year after that, in gold.
The king of that country had a beautiful daughter and had decreed that whoever would marry her must climb a glass mountain to win her.  She sat on the mountain with three golden apples in her lap; whoever took them would marry her and get half the kingdom.
The day of the trial, Boots's brothers refused to take him, but when the knights and princes had all failed, a knight appeared, whose equipment was brass.  The princess was much taken with him, and when he rode one-third of the way up and turned to go back, she threw an apple to him.  He took the apple and rode off too quickly to be seen.  The next trial, he went in the equipment of silver and rode two-thirds of the way, and the princess threw the second apple to him.  The third trial, he went in the equipment of gold, rode all the way, and took the third apple, but still rode off before anyone could catch him.

Each of the older brothers tried and failed, and they were turned to stone. For the youngest, however, the ants collected the pearls. The second task was to fetch the key to the princess's bedchamber from the lake, which the ducks did for him. The third task was to pick out the youngest princess from the three sleeping princesses who looked exactly alike; the only difference was that the oldest had eaten a bit of sugar before she slept, the second a little syrup, and the youngest some honey. The queen bee picked out the youngest.
This woke the castle, and restored those who had been turned to stone. The youngest son married the youngest princess, and his two brothers, the other princesses."

The king went to war, won a victory, and returned to his daughters' welcome.  He asked each one why her gown was the color it was; the older two had chosen theirs to symbolize their joy, and the youngest because it became her best. The king taxed her with vanity, and she said it was only to please him. Then he asked after their dreams. The older two had dreamed he was bringing them gifts; the youngest, that he had held a ewer for her to wash her hands in.
He sent the captain of the guards to take her into woods, kill her, and bring her heart and tongue back to him. The captain took her into the woods; her Moorish servants, dog, and monkey, all ran after. In the woods, he told her what he had been ordered. The servant, dog, and monkey, all offered to die in her place and indeed quarreled over it. The monkey climbed a tree and jumped from it, killing itself, but its tongue and heart were too small to deceive the king. The servant also killed herself, but her tongue was the wrong color. Finally, the captain killed the dog and went with its heart and tongue. The princess buried all three and went on.
She heard sheep and hoped to find refuge. She found a great ram, adorned with jewels, holding court. It made her welcome. The splendor of its home, which seemed inhabited by sheep and ghosts, terrified her. It explained that it was a prince, and an old and ugly fairy had captured him, trying to make him love her, but she had brought a beautiful slave with her, and his interest in the slave betrayed him. She killed the slave and turned him into a sheep. The others there, sheep and ghosts, were also this fairy's victims, and had taken him as their king. She lamented her servants, and the ram sent a servant to bring their shadows to the castle, where they lived with her.

She lived there until she heard of her eldest sister's wedding, which she attended, but left as soon as the ceremony was done, leaving a box of treasures for the bride, returning to the ram. She had been so richly dressed and well attended that no one recognized her, and the king wondered who she was.
Then she heard her second sister was to marry. The ram was distressed and declared that losing her would kill him. She said she would stay no longer than before, but the king had all the doors shut to detain her, and brought her an ewer to wash in. She told him the truth and everyone rejoiced, but she lost track of time. The ram came to the town, seeking to see her, but was refused, and died of grief. The princess saw him dead and was heart-broken."

It is Aarne–Thompson type 401, the girl transformed into an animal.

","A queen wished her naughty daughter would turn into a raven and fly away, so she could have some peace, and her wish was instantly fulfilled.  She flew away to a forest.
In the forest, a man heard a raven tell him she was an enchanted princess, and he could deliver her if he went to a certain cottage and accepted no food from the old woman there. The raven would drive by in a carriage every day for three days. If he remained awake, he would break the spell. Each day, the old woman persuaded him to drink but one sip, and each day, overcome by weariness, he was fast asleep by the time the raven drove past. On the final day, the raven left the sleeping man a bottle of wine, a loaf, and a piece of meat, all three of which were inexhaustible and put a gold ring with her name on his finger. She also gave him a letter telling him there was another way he might deliver her: by coming to the golden castle of Stromberg.
The man wandered, looking for the castle, and found a giant who threatened to eat him, but the man fed him with his magical provisions.  Then the giant brought out his map, which displayed all the towns, villages and houses in the land – but not the castle.  He asked the man to wait until his brother came home. The brother was able to find the castle on an older map, but it was thousands of miles away. The brother agreed to carry the man to within a hundred leagues of the castle, and the man walks the rest.
As the man approached the glass mountain on which the golden castle stood, he could see the bewitched princess drive her carriage around the castle and go in. But the glass mountain was too slippery for him to climb, and he lived in a hut at the foot of the mountain for a year. One day he met three robbers fighting over three magical items: a stick that opened doors, an invisibility mantle, and a horse that could ride up the glass-mountain. The man offered them a mysterious reward in exchange for the items, but he insisted on first trying them out, to see if they worked as promised. After he had mounted the horse, taken the stick, and was made invisible by the cloak, he hit the robbers with his stick and rode up the glass mountain. He used the stick and mantle to get into the castle and threw his ring into the princess's cup. She couldn't find her rescuer though she searched the entire castle, until he finally revealed himself by throwing off the mantle. They were married."

","A king named Milluccio once saw a dead raven on stone, and fell in love with the thought of a wife as black as the raven, as red as its blood, and as white as the stone.  It affected his health until his brother Jennariello asked what was wrong with him and finally learned the story.  Jennariello set out by ship.  He bought a falcon and a splendid horse, and a beggar persuaded him to tell his story.  The beggar then begged at a magician's house, and Jennariello saw that the magician's daughter, Liviella, matched his brother's dream exactly.  Jennariello dressed as a peddler and showed Liviella hoods, handkerchiefs, and other goods, and persuaded her to come to the ship to see his better wares.  Then he sailed off with her.  Liviella lamented, but Jennariello told her why, and described his brother to her so vividly that she wanted to see this man.
On the voyages, two doves flew up.  They talked, and one told the other that the falcon would pick out Milluccio's eyes the first time it saw him, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him the bird, Jennariello would turn to marble; that the horse would break Milluccio's neck the first time he rode it, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him the horse, he would turn to marble; and that a dragon would eat Milluccio and Liviella on their wedding night, but if Jennariello warned him, or did not bring him Liviella, Jennariello would turn to stone.
Jennariello brought his brother the horse and the falcon and then instantly killed them.  At the wedding night, Jennariello went with a sword and fought the dragon, but when his brother woke, the dragon vanished, and he had Jennariello imprisoned as a traitor that night and sentenced to die the next.  Wishing to die known as innocent, he told Milluccio his story, and turned to stone.
Liviella had twin sons.  One day, while she was gone, an old man asked Milluccio what he would give to restore his brother.  Milluccio said his kingdom, and when told life was needed, offered his own; when the old man said his sons' lives were needed, he killed them and put the blood on the statue, which restored them.  Liviella returned and was grief-stricken, and went to the window to throw herself out.

One day the eldest son was told by his mother to fetch water for a cake, because it was time for him to seek his fortune, and the cake was all she could give him. The can was broken, the water he brought back little, and so the cake was small. The mother offered him all of it with her curse, or half with her blessing, and he took the whole. He left behind a knife, and said if the blade grew rusty, he was dead.

He met a shepherd, a swineherd, and a goatherd; each of the three told him the Red Ettin of Ireland had kidnapped the king of Scotland's daughter, but that he was not the man to rescue her. The shepherd also told him to be wary of the beasts he would meet next. They each had two heads, with four horns on each head, and the man fled them and hid in a castle. An old woman told him that it was the castle of the Red Ettin, which had three heads, and he should leave, but he begged her to hide him as best she could, for fear of the beasts.
The Red Ettin returned, soon found him, and asked him three riddles; when he could answer none of them, the Ettin turned him to stone. At home, his knife grew rusty. In the variants with three sons, the younger brother went after the elder, and met the same fate. The youngest son, or the son of the other widow, set out after him, or them. First, a raven called over his head to look out as he brought the water, and so he patched up the holes and brought back enough water for a large cake. Then he left half with his mother for her blessing.
He met an old woman on the way who asked for a piece of his cake, and he gave it to her. She, being a fairy, gave him a magical wand and a great deal of advice on what to do, and vanished. The shepherd, swineherd, and goatherd told him of the Red Ettin and the king of Scotland's daughter, and said that he was the man to defeat him. He walked boldly through the beasts to the castle, striking one dead with the wand, and stayed at the castle.
The Red Ettin asked him his riddle, but the man answered and cut off the Ettin's three heads. He restored the stone and freed the women the Red Ettin held prisoner, and the king married him to his daughter."

When he told the prince what had happened and they came to the dead horse, a raven was already eating the corpse. Deciding they may not find better food that day, the servant killed the bird and took it with him. Next, they reached an inn and the servant gave the innkeeper the raven to make food of it. Unknown to the prince and his servant, the inn was really a robbers' den. The robbers returned, and, before killing the travellers, sat down to eat. Immediately after eating a few bites of the raven soup the innkeeper had prepared, the robbers fell down dead from the poison that the raven had in its body. The innkeeper's daughter then showed the prince and his servant the robbers' hidden treasure, but the prince insisted that the daughter keep it.
Continuing on, the prince and his servant next came to a town where a princess would marry any man who asked her a riddle that she could not solve. If she could solve it, the man's head would be cut off. The prince asked the princess, ""What slew none, and yet slew twelve?"" The princess could not solve the riddle, so she sent her maid to see if the prince revealed the riddle while talking in his sleep. The prince was prepared, however, because that night he had his servant sleep in his bed. When the maid came in, the servant ripped off her robe and chased her out.  Next, the princess sent her chambermaid to spy on the prince while he was asleep, but the prince's servant also ripped off her robe and chased her out. On the third night, the prince slept in his own bed, and the princess herself came in. The prince pretended to be asleep and the princess asked him the answer to the riddle. After the prince revealed the answer, the princess departed, but left her robe behind.
The next morning, the princess announced the answer of the riddle: ""A raven ate from a dead, poisoned horse, and died from it. Then, twelve robbers ate the raven and died from that."" The prince declared that the princess had not solved the riddle herself, but rather questioned him in his sleep. The town judges asked for proof, and the prince showed them the three robes. The judges ordered the princess's robe to be embroidered with gold and silver, for it was to be her wedding robe."

Joseph Jacobs included it, somewhat altered, in More Celtic Fairy Tales.

","A king's queen died when his son was born.  He remarried, and his new wife also had a son.  The stepmother tried to poison the first son so her son would inherit, but her son warned his brother.  The first son decided to flee before she succeed, and his brother went with him.  They tried the drinks she had given the older brother on their horses, and found they were poisonous.  Then twelve ravens came to eat the dead horses and died as well.  They took the ravens' bodies and had them made into pies.  When they went on, they were waylaid by robbers; they claimed to have no purses but some food.  The robbers took the pies, ate them, and died.  The brothers took their gold and silver and went on to the Ridere (or Knight) of Riddles, whose beautiful daughter would marry whoever asked a riddle her father could not guess.
There, they asked, ""One killed two, and two killed twelve, and twelve killed four and twenty, and two got out of it.""  The ridere could not guess, and sent maidens to wheedle the answer out.  Twelve maidens lost their plaids to the younger brother, but could not get the answer.  Finally, the princess herself went, and got the answer from the older brother, but left her plaid.  The ridere would have executed them, but the older brother told the story of how his brother had shot twelve hares and got their hides, and he had shot a fine one and gotten her hide, so the ridere married him to his daughter.  The younger brother went on, and the older gave him the right to the throne at home.
Three giants lived nearby, and the ridere told his son-in-law that if he had spirit, he would kill them.  He did it, and was named the Hero of the White Shield, and went to live on the giants' lands.  His brother heard of him, without knowing who he was, and went to fight with him.  They fought, and neither one won, and they told each other their names.
The brother went home, but on the way, he saw twelve young men playing at shinny and learned they were his twelve sons, by twelve different mothers.  He took both the young men and their mothers home with him."
the_robber_bridegroom__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Robber_Bridegroom_(fairy_tale),The Robber Bridegroom (fairy tale),"""The Robber Bridegroom"" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 40.  Joseph Jacobs included a variant, Mr Fox, in English Fairy Tales, but the original provenance is much older; Shakespeare (circa 1599) alludes to the Mr. Fox variant in Much Ado About Nothing, Act 1, Scene 1:
Like the old tale, my lord: ""it is not so, nor `t was not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so.""It is Aarne–Thompson type 955, the robber bridegroom.  This type is closely related to tales of type 312, such as Bluebeard, and type 311, such as How the Devil Married Three Sisters and Fitcher's Bird.","A miller wishes to marry his daughter off, and so when a rich suitor appears, he betroths her to him. One day the suitor complains that the daughter never visits him. He tells her that he lives in the forest and overrides her reluctance to visit by telling her he will leave a trail of ashes so she could find his home. She fills her pockets with peas and lentils and marks the trail with them as she follows the ashes.
They lead her to a dark and silent house. A bird in a cage calls out ""Turn back, turn back, thou bonnie bride, Nor in this house of death abide."" An old woman in a cellar kitchen tells her that the people there will kill and eat her unless the old woman protects her and hides her behind a cask. A band of robbers arrives with a young woman whom they kill and prepare to eat. When one chops off a finger to get at the golden ring on it, the finger and ring fly through the air and land in the lap of the hiding woman. The old woman discourages the group from searching for it, because ""neither the finger nor the ring are likely to run away: they will find it in the morning.""
The old woman then drugs the robbers' wine. As soon as they fall asleep, the two living women flee. Although wind has blown away the ashes that guided the miller's daughter to the house, the peas and lentils have sprung up into seedlings and the two follow the path of plants and reach the young woman's home.
When the wedding day arrives and the guests are telling stories, the bridegroom urges the young woman to tell a story. She says she will tell of a dream she had and tells the story of going to the murderers' den, in between each sentence saying, ""This was only a dream, my love!"" When she tells the part of the finger falling into her lap she produces the finger. The robber bridegroom and all his band are subsequently put to death."

It is Aarne–Thompson type 720, my mother slew me; my father ate me.  Another of this type is ""The Juniper Tree"", where the dead child is a boy; The Rose Tree is an unusual variant of this tale in that the main character is a girl.

","A long time ago there was a man who had two children; a daughter by his first wife and a son by his second.  His daughter was very beautiful, and although her brother loved her, his mother hated her.
The stepmother sent the daughter to the store to buy candles. But three times, the girl put down the candles to climb a stile, and a dog stole them. When the daughter returned, her stepmother told her to come and let her comb her hair.  The stepmother claimed that she could not comb it on her knee, or with the comb, and sent the girl for a piece of wood and an axe. When she returned, the stepmother cut off her head.
She stewed her heart and liver, and her husband tasted them and said they tasted strangely.  The brother did not eat but buried his sister under a rose-tree.  Every day he wept under it.
One day, the rose-tree flowered, and a white bird appeared.  It sang to a cobbler and received a pair of red shoes; it sang to a watchmaker and received a gold watch and chain; it sang to three millers and received a millstone.  Then it flew home and rattled the millstone against the eaves.  The stepmother said that it thundered, and the boy ran out, and the bird dropped the shoes at his feet.  It rattled the millstone again, the stepmother said that it thundered, the father went out, and the bird dropped the watch and chain at his feet.  It rattled the millstone a third time, and the stepmother went out, and the bird dropped the millstone on her head."

The tale is a local form of the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband, in that a woman marries a man of supernatural origin, loses him and must regain him.

","While walking on the road, a Brahman finds a shining red ruby on the ground. He picks it up and pockets it into his garments. Feeling hungry, the Brahman enters a corn-merchant's shop and offers the ruby as payment for the food. The corn-merchant stuns at the sight of the ruby, clearly worth more than anything in his store, and suggets the Brahman takes it to the king.
The Brahman sells the ruby to the king for a lakh of rupees and goes on his merry way. The king then gives the ruby to the queen for safekeeping, and she hides it in a locked trunk. Twelve years later, the king decides to open up the casket to see his ruby, but a youth comes out of it. The king questions the youth about his appearance and the fate of the ruby. The youth answers he is the Ruby Prince, and that is the only answer he can give. The king then orders him to be exiled from the kingdom from this perceived affront.
In his wanderings, the Ruby Prince reaches a town, and sees an old woman crying. The old woman explains that their realm is menaced by an ogre, and this time her son is next to be sacrificed to the monster. The Ruby Prince decides to save the old woman's son and vanquish the ogre, and asks the old woman to lodge there for some time. The next day, he  rides his horse to the ogre's meeting spot, kills him, and impales the ogre's head on a spike to show the town the monster is dead. He then returns to the old woman's house to sleep some more.
The townspeople see the ogre's head and alert the king, who goes to the old woman's house, since it was her son's who was supposed to be the ogre's next victim. The old woman tells the king the ogre is dead and her son is safe, and that their saviour is sleeping in her house. The king enters the house and sees that the sleeping youth was the one he drove forth from the palace. He consults with his ministers, who advise him to give his daughter to the youth as a reward for killing the ogre.
The Ruby Prince and the king's daughter marry in a grand ceremony. Some time later, the princess keeps hearing the gossip of the female courtier about her having married a stranger from who-knows-where. Intrigued by her husband's origins, she asks the Ruby Prince about his past, his origins, but he refuses to divulge any information.
One day, the princess and the Ruby Prince are near a river side, and she is still questioning him about his previous life. The Ruby Prince steps in the water as the princess insists to know her husband's name. He slowly sinks into the water as his wife is still questioning him, until ""a jewelled snake with a golden crown and ruby star"" appears in the water, looks at the princess with a sorrowful expression, then disappears beneath the water.
The princess despairs at her decision, and offers a bushel of gold to anyone who can bring her information about her husband. Time passes and, without news of her husband, she grows ill, until one day a dancing-woman comes to the court. The dancing-woman tells her about a strange occurrence: while she was gathering sticks, she rested for a bit near a tree, after she woke up, she saw a bright light, then a sweeper came out of a snake-hole, a water-carrier sprinkling water on the ground, and two carpet-bearers; music began to play, as a procession came out of the hole, a youth of majestic appearance at the front, and among his retinue a man with a red star on the forehead who began to dance before the king.
The princess and the dancing-woman go to the tree and wait for the strange procession to come out of the snake-hole. The same servants come, prepare the way for the procession, and the king comes with his retinue. The princess recognizes her husband among the king's retinue by a red star he is wearing. The princess notices the Ruby Prince's wan aspect.
The dancing-girl explains her plan to the princess to save her husband: since the Snake-King is delighted at the dances, the princess should learn to dance, dance before the Snake-King in a way he is to be so impressed that he could grant anything. The princess is taught by the dancing-girl and surpasses her.
Finally, the princess returns to the tree and waits for the Snake-King's retinue. After they come, and the Snake-King forces the Ruby Prince to dance before him, the princess, wearing veiled garments and decorated with jewels, begins to dance before the King. So impressive are her dancing moves that the Snake King grants her a favor. The princess, then,  asks to be given the man for whom she danced. The Snake-King fumes at her answer and threatens to kill her, but remembers his promise and lets her take the Ruby Prince away from the retinue."
the_scarlet_flower,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Flower,The Scarlet Flower,"The Scarlet Flower (Russian: Аленький цветочек, Alen'kiy tsvetochek), also known as The Little Scarlet Flower or The Little Red Flower, is a Russian folk tale written by Sergey Aksakov. It is an adaptation of traditional fairy tale Beauty and the Beast. In Russia, Beauty and the Beast story is known mostly via Aksakov's retelling.

","Once upon a time there lived a wealthy merchant, who had three beautiful daughters. Once he decided to do business overseas. He called for the daughters and asked what gifts should he bring them. The eldest asked for a golden tiara adorned with precious gems that sparkled brightly, and the second wanted a crystal mirror which always showed the person's reflection as young and beautiful. The merchant knew these would be difficult to obtain, but within his means. The youngest, named Nastenka (a diminutive form of the given name Anastasia), asked for the most beautiful scarlet flower in the world, which she had seen in a dream. The merchant did not know where he could find such a flower, but promised not to disappoint.
Everything went well. The merchant bought all gifts, except for the scarlet flower. He saw many scarlet flowers, but not the most beautiful one. On the way home he was attacked by robbers, fled into the woods and became lost. When he awoke the next morning he saw a splendid palace ""in flame, silver and gold"". He walked inside, marveling at the splendor, but the palace was seemingly empty. Spread before him was a luxurious feast, and he sat down and ate. When he walked out to the garden he saw the most beautiful scarlet flower, and knew it was the one his daughter desired. Upon picking it, the terrible Beast of the Forest leapt out and confronted the merchant, asking him why he dared pick the scarlet flower, the one joy of the beast's life.  The beast demanded that the merchant repay him and forfeit his life. The merchant begged for mercy and to be returned to his daughters. The beast allowed this on the one condition that within the next three days one of his daughters would willingly take her father's place and live with the beast, or the merchant's life would be forfeit. The beast gave the merchant a ring, and the girl that put it on the littlest finger of her right hand would be transported to the palace. Then the beast magically transported the merchant home, with all his wealth and treasures restored.
The merchant explained what happened to his three daughters.  The eldest two believed the youngest should go, since it was her present that caused this disaster. The youngest daughter loved her father so, so she willingly went to live with the beast.  Nastenka lived luxuriously with the beast, who granted her every desire, fed her delicious food and gave her rich jewels and clothing, yet never revealed himself to her for fear of upsetting her.  However Nastenka became fond of the beast and asked to see him.  When he finally revealed himself to her, she was overcome with fear but controlled herself, and apologized to the beast for upsetting him.   When Nastenka had a dream that her father was ill, the Beast let her visit him. However, he said that she must come back in three days, otherwise he would perish, since his love for her was so great he loved her more than himself, and could not bear to be apart from her.

Nastenka's visit to her father revived his spirits, but her sisters resented the wealth she lived in.  They tried to talk her out of returning to the Beast, but Nastenka could not be so cruel to her kind host. The elder sisters put the clocks back and closed the windows, to trick Nastenka. When Nastenka felt that something had been wrong and came back to the Monster's palace, he lay dying near the scarlet flower. Nastenka rushed to his side, took him in her arms, and cried that she loved him more than herself, that he was her true love. All of a sudden thunder boomed, and Nastenka was transported to a golden throne next to a handsome prince.  The handsome prince explained that he was the Beast, cursed by a witch who was fighting his father, a mighty king. To break the curse, a maiden had to fall in love with him in his monstrous form. The merchant gave his blessing to the young couple, who lived happily ever after."

","A princess had a magical tower with twelve windows, and whenever she looked from a window, she saw more clearly from it than the one before.  Being haughty, she had no wish to marry, and decreed that any suitor must hide from her to win her, but if she found him, he was to lose his head.  After ninety-seven lost their lives, three brothers presented themselves, and the first two lost.  The youngest son asked for three tries.  He went hunting and spared a raven, a fish, and a fox.  The raven tried to hide him in an egg, where he could be seen only from the eleventh window.  The fish swallowed him, where he could be seen only from the twelfth.  The fox turned him into a pretty sea-hare and sold him, to the princess.  When she went to the windows, he hid in her hair.  She could not see him and angrily threw the sea-hare out of her hair.  He sneaked off, the fox restored him, and he went to claim her, and they married."
the_sea_maiden,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea-Maiden,The Sea-Maiden,"The Sea-Maiden is a Scottish fairy tale collected by John Francis Campbell in Popular Tales of the West Highlands, listing his informant as John Mackenzie, fisherman, near Inverary.  Joseph Jacobs included it in Celtic Fairy Tales.

","A mermaid offered a fisherman much fish in return for his son.  He said he had none.  In Campbells' version, she offered him grains:  three for his wife, three for a mare, three for a dog, three to plant in the yard; then there would be three sons, three foals, three puppies, and three trees, and she should have one son when he was three.  In Jacobs's version, she merely said he would have a son, and when the boy was twenty, she would take him.
In Campbell's version, the mermaid let him put her off until the boy was twenty.
In both, the father grew troubled.  The son (or oldest son) wormed the problem out of him, and told him to get him a good sword.  He set out on horseback, with a dog, and came to where a dog, a falcon, and an otter quarreled over a sheep carcass.  He split it up for them if they came with him and aided him.
He took service with a king, as a cowherd, and his pay was according to the milk.  Nearby, the grass was poor, and so were the milk and his wages, but he found a green valley.  When he pastured the cows there, a giant challenged him for grazing in his valley.  He killed the giant.  Taking none of its treasure, he took back the cows, which gave good milk.  The next day, he took the cows further and had to fight another giant, with help from the dog.  The third day after that, he took them still further and met a hag who tried to trick him, but he killed her with the help of the dog.
When he went back, everyone was lamenting.  A monster with three heads lived in the loch, and got someone every year; this year the lot had fallen to the king's daughter.  The general said he would rescue her, and the king had promised to marry him to the daughter if he did.  The son went to see.  When the monster appeared, the general ran off.  The princess saw a doughty man on a black horse, with a black dog, appear.  He fought the creature and had off one head, drawing a withy through it.  He gave it the princess, who gave him a ring.  He went back to his cows, and the general threatened to kill her if she did not say that he did it.  The next day, the king's daughter had to go back, because there were two heads left.  The son came again and slept, telling her to rouse him when the creature came; she did, putting an earring of hers on his ear as he said, and they fought, and he cut off the second head.  The same thing happened the third time, and the creature died.
The king sent for the priest to marry his daughter to the general.  The king's daughter said that first he must take the heads from the withy.  He could not.  Finally, the cowherd did.  The king's daughter said the actual killer had her ring and two earrings, and he produced them.  The king, displeased, ordered him better dressed; the king's daughter said he had good clothing, and he dressed in golden clothing from the giant's castle to marry her.
One day they walked by the loch, and the sea-maiden took the prince.  The princess was advised by an old smith to wear her jewelry and offered it to the sea-maiden for the prince, in Campbell's variant, which she agreed to, or by a soothsayer to play music and not stop until the sea-maiden gave her a sight of the prince, which let the prince call on the falcon and escape.
But the princess was captured.
The same person who advised the prince told him that on an island, there was a white deer.  If it were caught, a hoodie crow would jump from it; if it were captured, a trout would spring from it, but there would be an egg in the trout's mouth, and if it were broken, the sea-maiden would die.
The sea-maiden sank any boat that came to the island, but his horse and dog jumped to it.  The dog chased the deer.  The prince called on the dog from the sheep carcass, and with its aid, caught it.   The hoodie sprang out, and with the falcon from the carcass, he caught it.  The trout sprang out, and with the aid of the otter from the carcass, he caught it.  The sea-maiden told him she would do what he asked if he would spare her.  He demanded his wife.  When she gave her back, he squeezed the egg and killed her."

","A human king helps an injured eagle that, in return, the eagle takes the king on a journey and gives him two magical caskets. The human king opens the caskets and cannot close them, until the Sea Tsar appears to him. The Sea Tsar offers to help in exchange for the thing ""you do not know is in your own house."" What the king does not know, is that he now has a newly born son.
The king arrives at home and discovers the terrible mistake he made: he unwittingly surrendered his own son to the creature. Years later, the prince is informed of this. The king takes him to the sea shore to leave for the Sea Tsar. The prince wanders off into a forest and meets a witch (Baba Yaga), who informs him that the daughters of the Sea Tsar come to bathe in a lake in bird form (the animals vary between versions).
The Tsarevitch spies on the maidens and hides the garment (featherskin) of the youngest one. Her sisters fly off back home, but she stays and asks the youth to come out of hiding. He gives the garment back and she departs.
Some time later, the Tsarevitch arrives at the underwater realm of the Morskoi Tsar (""Sea King"" or ""Water King"") to fulfill his father's deal. The Sea King, then, commands the boy to perform three difficult tasks, one on each day. The prince reveals his woes to Vasilisa the Wise, the Sea Tsar's youngest daughter, and she assuages him that their tasks shall be done.

After the tasks are done, the Sea Tsar congratulates the Tsarevitch and bids him choose a wife out of his twelve daughters. Vasilisa the Wise conspires with the human prince to cheat on the choice.
After they marry, the Tsaretvitch confesses to his wife his wish to visit his parent again, but Vasilisa warns that, it they escape, the Sea Tsar will chase them. They make their way to ""Holy Russia"", the Tsarevitch's homeland, but twice the Sea Tsar sends a hunting party after them. Vasilisa the Wise uses her powers to hide her and his husband with magical disguises to fool her father's allies.
The third time, the Sea Tsar himself goes hot in pursuit. So Vasilisa transforms into a duck and him into a drake. The Sea Tsar arrives at the lake and, shapeshifted into an eagle, tries to grab the two waterfowls with its claws, but they submerge into the lake to avoid the attack.
The Sea Tsar gives up and returns to his underwater realm, while Vasilisa and the Tsarevitch go home safely and celebrate their wedding.
(In some variants, the magic maiden says he should not kiss anyone in the palace, lest he forgets about her. When he does so, she is forgotten by the prince. Some time later, the prince announces his marriages to another princess, and the magic maiden arrives at the ceremony to make her beloved remember.)"

It is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 425A, ""Animal as Bridegroom"".

","Pálkó's narration begins thus: a king complains to his wife that she has not born him any child. The queen questions why God has not given her children, and asks for a snake son, so that they may finally have offspring. Just as she says it, a snake son appears. The king declares they must hide the animal from prying eyes, so that no one may know they have a snake son.
They hide the animal son in a room and he grows up there. Years later, when he has grown very large, he begins to whistle so loud it shakes the castle. His mother pays him a visit to question what is the reson for the whistling. He explains he has come of age and desires a mate, and suggests the princess of a neighbouring kingdom shall be the perfect candidate.
So his mother summons the princess and she comes to the castle to find out more about her prospective husband. The queen leads the princess into the prince's quarters. When she sees the giant snake, she screams and faints. The queen sprinkles some water on her, who comes to, and explains the prince is the snake, albeit a harmless one. The princess refuses to marry the snake prince and tries to escape te room, whose windows are barred with iron. The queen and the king lock her up with the snake prince and leave them be.
This situation goes for a week: the princess tries to think of a way out, but everywhere she looks the windows and the doors are barred. She does not even touch her food, choosing to wither away slowly than marrying the snake. Despite his bride's grievances, the snake prince tries to convince the girl he means no harm to her. He then begins to crawl into their bridal bed, to the princess's horror. For two nights, she tries to sneak away from him, somewhat successfully.
The third night, after a quick rest, she wakes up to a handsome man beside her. She wakes the man up and question his presence there: he tells her he is the snake, but wears a snakeskin at night ""because he has too"", since it is his ""cloak"". The princess feels more at ease and they live as husband and wife, she becoming pregnant some time later.
Despite the revelation, the prince does not show his parents his human form, which annoys the princess. She visits a sorceress nearby and tells her her situation. The sorceress advises her to take the snakeskin and burn it in the stove.
That night, when the snake prince is asleep, the princess wakes up, takes the snakeskin off of him. She creeps into the kitchen, lights up the stove and tosses the skin in. She returns to her chambers to a awakened prince, who asks her about the smell of burning. She lies that it is only some tufts of her hair burning, but he knows she is lying. The prince then explains that he was to wear the cloak for one more month, and curses her not to bear their children until he embraces her again; and that a ring on her finger shall stay there until he puts his finger on her. He then gives her a dry hazel-rod she must water with her tears until it bears fruit, and a grain of wheat she must plant and with the harvest bake a bread; then she can go after him. Then he vanishes.
The princess tells her parents-in-law that the snake prince has disappeared, and goes to water the dry hazel-rod and the grain of wheat. After a long time, she takes the rod and the bread and starts a journey. In a forest, she sees a light in the distance - an old woman (the mother of the Moon)'s house, where she takes shelter for the night. Her son comes home and is inquired about the whereabouts of the Serpent Prince. The old woman directs the princess to her aunt, and gives her a gold bobbin.
The situation repeats twice in the next two houses (of the Sun and of the Winds), and she gains a golden reel and a golden spool and ball of thread; only on the third house she finally learns where her husband is: the Hurricane Wind tells her he went to his castle and he can take her there.
The princess arrives at the castle and wanders about with the gold bobbin. A maidservant appears and guides the girl to the queen, who is interested in the golden item and wishes to buy it. The princess offers it in exchange for a night in the king's chambers. She enters the chambers and begs her husband to awake and see her. She fails and weeps bitterly until dawn, when the queen expels her from the room. The second night goes much the same.
On the third day, the king's valet tells him that a woman has come to his chambers and wept at his bedside, but he could not respond. The king surmises he was drugged with a sleeping potion, and asks his valet to pour any drink he receives out in the bath. The princess sells her the golden thread, hoping she can wake him up. She enters the room and begs her husband to wake up and touch her breast. He does and she gives birth to their children: two golden-haired boys.
The queen enters the room, intending to expel the woman, but the king orders the guards to seize her and lock her up in a cell. The king summons his advisers, who counsel him that a wedded woman is better that an unwed one. He stays with the princess and his two sons, and punishes the queen."
the_seven_foals,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Foals,The Seven Foals,"The Seven Foals (in Norwegian : De syv folene) is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe.
The hero of the story is sometimes called, in an analogue to Cinderella, Cinder-lad.

","A poor couple had three sons, the youngest of whom would lie about in the ashes.
The oldest went to the king to enter his service.   The king set him to watch his seven foals all day and find out what they ate and drank.  If he succeeded, he would marry the princess and receive half the kingdom; if he failed, he would have three strips taken out of his back.
The next morning, he had to chase after the seven foals and grew so tired that when an old woman, spinning, called him to stay with her and let her comb his hair, he did.  In the evening, he was going to return home, but the old woman told him the seven foals would come back this way, and gave him moss and water to give to the king as what they ate and drank.  The king had three stripes cut from his back and salt rubbed in them, and the oldest son went home.
The middle brother tried next, but it went with him as with his older brother.
The youngest brother decided to go, which made his brothers jeer at him and his parents plead, but he went.  He took the same job as his brothers, but ran past the old woman, at which the youngest foal told him to ride it, because they had far to go.  They reached a birch tree, and in a room inside it there were a sword and a pitcher.  The foals asked him to wield the sword, which he could not, until he had drunk three times from the pitcher.  They then made him promise to cut off their heads on his wedding day, because they were the princess's brothers, a troll had enchanted them into this form, and that would free them.  Then they went on to a church where they received bread and wine from the priest, and the youngest son took some with him when they left.
When the king received the bread and wine, he made arrangements for the wedding, and when the youngest son cut off the foals' head and restored them as princes to their father, the king promised him the entire kingdom after he died."

","A dying queen required her husband to promise to remarry only if the new bride was as beautiful as she was.  Because he had only a daughter, soon after her death, he decided to remarry.

the_silent_princess,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silent_Princess,The Silent Princess,"The Silent Princess is a Turkish fairy tale.  Andrew Lang included it in The Olive Fairy Book.  It contains inset tales that are similar to ones in Arabian Nights.

","A pasha's son one day was playing with his golden ball, and three times broke a woman's pitcher.  She cursed him to fall in love with the silent princess, and vanished.  As he grew older, he wondered who the silent princess was, and in time wondered so much that he became ill.  His father asked what had made him ill, in hopes that it would reveal his cure, and the son revealed the curse and asked permission to search the world for her.  His father granted it.
The prince set out with an old steward, and after three old men gave them directions and warnings, he finally found the mountain where the princess sat behind seven veils and never spoke.  The mountain was surrounded by human bones and mourners, who warned the prince that he needed the leave of the sultan to be escorted into the princess's presence, and the bones could tell him the effect of his decision.  The prince could not think of a way to make her talk, so he put off speaking to the sultan until he had one.
While there, the prince bought a nightingale, and found it could talk. It asked him why he was so sad, and when he told the bird his story, she told him to go, and when the princess would not speak, he must tell her he would instead converse with the candlestick, where the nightingale would be hidden.  The prince obeyed.  The princess would not speak to him, so he spoke to the candlestick, and the nightingale said it had been years since anyone had spoken to her, so she would tell him a story.
She described how a king set three wooers to learn something in six months, and the cleverest would win the princess.  One learned how to travel a year's journey in an hour; another to see things at a distance; the third to cure any illness.  They met again, and the second saw the princess was dying, the first brought the third to her, and the third one cured her.  Then the prince and the nightingale argued whether the second or the third had done the better, until the princess burst out that it would have been useless without the first, who should have her.
A slave ran to tell the sultan, but the princess persuaded him, by signs, to make the prince make her speak three times.  She destroyed the candlestick.
The next night, the nightingale hid on a pillar, and the prince talked to it.  The nightingale told of a woman who had scorned wooers for many years, until she found a white hair and decided to pick one.  She set them to tasks.  She told the first wooer that her father had died, and proved to be a wizard because his grave was empty; the man's task was to lay in the grave three hours, so the woman would be free of him.  He lay down there at once.  She told a second wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave; if he stood over the wizard with a stone and smashed his head if he moved, she would be free.  The man took such a stone and sat down at once.  She told a third wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave, but if he brought him before her, she would be free.  He immediately brought the body before her.  Then the nightingale argued whether the second or third wooer had done the best, until the princess said it was the first.  That day, she destroyed the pillar.
The third night, the nightingale hid in the curtains by the door, and told the prince of a carpenter, a tailor, and a student who lived in the same house.  The carpenter made a statue of a woman; the tailor dressed it; the student prayed to heaven that she might become a living woman.  The nightingale and prince quarreled over whether the carpenter or the tailor had the best right to marry her, until the princess said that the student's prayer meant he should win her. 
At that, her veils fell, and she agreed to marry the prince.  They sent for the woman whose pitchers he had broken, and she became a nurse to their children."

","There is a man with three daughters. One day, he must leave on a journey and asks each of his daughters what they would like him to bring back. The oldest wants diamonds, the second pearls, and the youngest a singing, springing lark. The man is able to find diamonds and pearls, but he fails to find a lark. On his journey home, the man sees a lark in a tall tree, and orders his servant to catch it.  Suddenly a lion springs out and threatens to kill them both for trying to steal the lark. In exchange for their lives and the lark, the lion demands that the man bring him the first thing to meet him on his return home. The man fears it will be his youngest daughter who greets him, but his servant persuades him to accept the bargain.
Just as the man has feared, his youngest daughter is the first to greet him. When told of his promise, the daughter consoles her father and sets out the next morning to meet the lion. At the lion's castle, she is greeted by lions that, at night, turn human and she marries the lion whose lark her father had tried to take and lives with him, sleeping by day.
One night the lion tells her that her oldest sister is marrying and offers to send her with his lions.  She goes, and her family is glad to see her.  After her return, the lion tells her that her second sister is marrying, and she says he must go with her and their child.  The lion tells her that if any candlelight falls on him, he will be transformed into a dove for seven years.  The youngest daughter has a chamber built to protect him, but the door is made of green wood, and it warps, making a crack.  When her sister's wedding procession goes by, candlelight falls on him, and he turns into a dove.
The dove tells his wife that for every seven steps she takes, he will drop a feather and a drop of blood, and perhaps she can track him by that, and flies off.
When the seven years are nearly up, the youngest daughter loses the trail. She climbs up to the sun and asks after the white dove; the sun does not know, but gives her a casket.  She then asks the moon, who does not know, but gives her an egg.  She asks the night wind, and it can not help her but tells her to wait for the others; the east and west wind can not, but the south wind says that the dove was again a lion and fighting a dragon that is an enchanted princess near the Red Sea.  The night wind advises her to strike the lion and dragon with a certain reed, to allow the lion to win and both creatures to regain their form, and then to escape on the back of a griffin.  It gives her a nut that will grow to a nut tree in the middle of the sea, which would allow the griffin to rest.
The youngest daughter stops the fight, but the princess also regains her form and takes the man who had been a lion with her on the griffin.  The daughter follows until she finds a castle where the princess and her husband are to be married.
She opens the casket and finds a dazzling dress in it.  She brings it to the castle, and the princess buys it from her, the price being that the daughter is to spend the night in her husband's bedchamber. But it is to no avail because the princess has a page give him a sleeping draught.  Though the daughter pleads with him, he thinks it is the wind's whistling.
The next day, she opens the egg.  It holds a chicken with twelve golden chicks.  The princess again buys them for the same price, but this time her husband asks the page what was the wind the previous night, and the page confesses to the draught.  He does not drink it the second night, and he and his wife flee on the griffin to their home."

Lie still unburied, beneath the wave

","A long time ago, the ruler of Persia, Khosrow Shah, disguises himself to mingle with his people to hear their thoughts. One night, he approaches a house where three sisters are talking; the eldest says she wants to marry the sultan's baker so she can eat all the best bread; the middle one wants to marry the sultan's cook so she can taste the most delicious dishes. As for the third sister, she declares she wants to marry the king himself, and promises to give him a child with hair of gold and silver, their tears will become pearls and whenever they smile, rosebuds will appear.The Shah orders his vizier to bring the girls to his presence the next morning, so he can fulfill their wishes: he marries the two elder sisters to the baker and the cook, while he weds the third sister. Despondent at their lowly marriage, the new queen's two sisters plot to humiliate her and make her lose the king's favour. As soon as the first royal child is born (a boy), the jealous aunts take the boy, put him a cradle and cast him into a stream that passes by the palace. In his place, they put a puppy to deceive the Sultan. The cradle is carried by the stream to the outskirts of the royal palace, where he is found by a high official (superintendent of the gardens) and the gardener. The official takes the boy to his wife to raise him as his own.
Nine more months pass, and the Sultana gives birth to a second prince. Her jealous sisters replace the boy for a second puppy and cast him in the stream in a basket. The little prince, however, is rescued by the king's gardener and raised by the superintendent of the gardens. The following year, the Sultana gives birth to a girl, and she is also subject to the trickery of the jealous aunts: the little princess is cast in a basket into a stream, but she is saved by the superintendent of the gardens. Enraged at the false promises of his wife, the Sultan orders her to be banished from the palace and locked in a box or small hut in front of the mosque, and for any person that goes to the mosque to spit at her face.
Meanwhile, the superintendent of the gardens raises the royal siblings as his own children. In one version of the story, the brothers are named Bahman and Parviz (Perviz), and the sister Parizade. In another version, they are called Farid, Farouz and Farizade. Their adoptive father buys for them a palace outside of the city and moves there with his family. After he dies, the three siblings inherit the place. One day, while her brothers are hunting, Parizade stays at home and is visited by an old Muslim woman. She entertains her visitor with food and questions about her wanderings. The old woman answers that Parizade's palatial home is indeed beautiful, and their garden equally as magnificent, but it lacks three objects: the Talking Bird that draws other birds with its voice; the Singing Tree, whose leaves produce songs; and the Golden Water that can fill a basin and never exhaust nor overflow.
The old Muslim woman points the direction of the fabled treasures: they are to be found in the same place, if one goes towards India. The old woman departs and Parizade tells her brothers of the objects, and convinces them their house needs all three. Bahman, the elder brothers, offers to get the three treasures and gives Parizade a knife: if the knife appears rusty after some time, some peril has befallen him.
Bahman meets a dervish on the way with long beard, long hair and long fingernails. The youth cuts parts of the dervish's beard and he, in gratitude, advises him: he will see a mountain with black stones on the side; he is to climb the mountain up to the top and not pay heed to the voices that echo in the mountain, nor he is to turn aound his neck to see behind him. Bahman listens to his advice and arrives at the mountain. He sees a yard of black stones nearby - the petrified remains of those who failed to get the treasures -, and begins to climb the mountain. However, his strength begins to fail, and he decides to turn back and climb down the mountain, and is transformed into a black stone.
Back at their palace, Parizade sees that the knife has become rusty and realizes something must have happened to Bahman. Her brother Perviz decides to go after him and the treasures, despite Parizade's protests, and gives her a string of pearls; if the pearls are not movable, then something also happened to him. Perviz rides to the dervish's location and receives the same advice. Perviz begins to ascend the mountain, but, as soon as he hears the voices taunting him, he turns around, sword in hand, and becomes stone, just like the others.
Finally, Parizade, realizing her brothers' sad fates, disguises herself in man's garments and rides a horse to the dervish's location. She talks to the dervish, and tells him of her plan: she will cover her ears with cotton to muffle the voices. Sure of her success, she then goes to the mountain where the Talking Bird's cage is. She soldiers on to the mountain summit and touches the bird's cage. The Talking Bird congratulates her and submits to her. Parizade asks the bird the location of the Golden Water and the Singing Tree.
Parizade then asks the bird how she can disenchant her brothers and everyone else turned to stone. The bird points to a small bowl with water that she can use on the black stones. She follows the bird's instructions and releases Bahman and Perviz, along with many others, from the petrification spell.
Parizade and her brothers return home with the bird, the water and a branch of the Singing Tree: they put the cage by the door, build a fountain to put the golden water and plant the branch on their garden.
Some time later, Bahman and Perviz meet the Sultan during a hunt. Ths Sultan is impressed with their skills and invites them to his palace. The brothers refuse the invitation for now, but tell the Sultan they will consult with Parizade first. Parizade says she will consult with the Talking Bird, which agrees with them accepting the Sultan's invitation.

The next day, Bahman and Perviz invite the Sultan to meet Parizade. The girl consults with the bird and it says to prepare a meal of cucumber with pearls for the Sultan. The Sultan arrives at their palatial home and is given a tour of the place, admiring the Fountain of Golden Water, the music of the Singing Tree and the songs of the Talking Bird.
Finally, they sit down for dinner, and the Sultan is given a dish of cucumber with pearls. The Sultan states that the dish is inedible, and the Talking Bird retorts that the Sultan notices a matter trivial as this, but believed the false claims of his sisters-in-law. The Talking Bird reveals Bahman, Perviz and Parizade are his children. The Sultan learns of the truth, condemns his sisters-in-law to be executed and reconciles with his wife."

He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be mistreated by his new wife; so, he sends them away to a hidden castle and visits them in secret.
The new queen and now stepmother, who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get rid of them. She sews six magical white shirts, goes to the hidden castle, and tosses the shirts over the boys, transforming them into swans.
The princes' still human sister runs away, finding her brothers in a hunter's hut. The princes can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their sister that they have heard of a way to lift the curse: for six years, she mustn't speak while making six shirts out of star-flowers for her brothers. On the other hand, if she speaks before the end of the sixth year, the spell will never be broken. The Princess agrees to do this and, taking shelter in a tree, dedicates herself solely to gathering the star-flowers and sewing in silence.
At the beginning of the fourth year, the King of another country finds the Princess sewing, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the infant and accuses the Queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it.
The young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the Queen is sentenced to be burned at the stake as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, and sewing the star-flower shirts no matter what.
On the day of her execution, the Queen has finished making all the shirts for her brothers. When she is brought to the stake, she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the six years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, although the youngest brother's left arm remains a wing due to his own shirt missing a sleeve (in some variants, the sister is unable to finish the last shirt in time, leaving her youngest brother a swan permanently).
The Queen is now free to speak and, with her brothers' support, defends herself against the accusations against her. The Queen's three missing children are found alive and her evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.
In the end, the queen, her husband, 
three children, and six brothers live happily ever after."

the_snowman__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman_(fairy_tale),The Snowman (fairy tale),"""The Snowman"" (Danish: Sneemanden) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove. It was published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen as Sneemanden on 2 March 1861.  Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager describes the tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to Andersen's ""The Fir-Tree"" of December 1844.There is a sharp division over Anderson physical fulfillment in the sexual sphere and how it relates to this tale. Wullschlager believes ""The Snowman"" was the product in part of Andersen's ""pining and discontent over"" Harald Scharff, a handsome young dancer at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen.  According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet ""some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness."" According to Anne Klara Bom and Anya Aarenstrup from the H. C. Andersen Centre of University of Southern Denmark, ""it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen's emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not. Indeed, that would have been entirely contrary to his moral and religious ideas, aspects that are quite outside the field of vision of Wullschlager and her like.""

","""The Snowman"" begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise. He is only a day old, and quite naïve and inexperienced. His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch. The dog senses a change in the weather, enters his kennel and goes to sleep.
At dawn, the land is covered in frosty whiteness when a young couple enter the garden to admire the scene and the Snowman. When they leave, the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into ""the same kennel and share their bones"". He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper's room as a pampered pet. The Snowman can see the stove through a window in the house and believes it is female. He falls in love. The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove, but the dog warns him he would melt.
All day the Snowman gazes upon the stove, and, at twilight, the stove glows. When the door of the room is opened, the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. The dog warns the snowman of an imminent change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the Snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the Snowman within his remains, and then understands why the Snowman longed for the stove: ""That's what moved inside him... Now he is over that, too!"" The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten."

It is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 462, ""The Outcast Queens and the Ogress Queen"".

","The tale, as Steel had published it, was titled The Son of Seven Mothers. Folklorist Joseph Jacobs republished it in his book Indian Fairy Tales, with the title The Son of Seven Queens.

A king has seven wives, but no son yet. A fakir comes to him and predicts that one of his queens shall bear him a son. The king orders preparations for a grand festivity. While everything is being set up, the king goes on a hunt, despite the warnings of one of his wives. He sights a white deer in the woods and becomes transfixed with capturing it. He gallops after it and reaches a miserable hut in the forest.
The king enters the hut and sees an old woman working at the spinning wheel. She calls for her daughter, and a beautiful white-skinned and golden-haired woman. She goes for a drink of water, and, by looking into her eyes, the king realizes she is the white hind. He becomes entranced by her beauty, and wishes to take her as his next wife. She agrees, with the condition that he takes out the eyes of the other queens.
The white hind woman's cruel wish is carried out, and her eyes are given to her mother. The seven queens are cast into prison. While in captivity, one of the queens gives birth to a son, to the jealousy of the others. But soon enough, their jealousy subsides and gives way to care and affection, and the seven women regard the son as their own child.
The boy scrapes the walls of the prison to dig out a hole large enough for him to pass through to the outside and fetch sweetmeats for the imprisoned women. One day, when he is old enough, he begins to hunt bigger game for them with bow and arrow, and meets the wicked queen. She realizes the boy is the son of one of the other queens and tells him she can direct him to get their eyes back. The boy accepts and gets from her a letter, with a command to kill him as soon as he delivers the letter to her mother.
During his journey, the boy arrives at a kingdom whose princess has refused to marry any suitor. When this princess sees the boy, she decides he is the one. The princess reads the letter and alters it with a request for the boy to be treated right. The boy goes to the queen's mother's hut and gets from her the garland of eyes, albeit lacking one. The boy returns home and restores the eyes of the seven queens.
Seeing that her statagem failed, the white hind queen tells him he can get the ""Jogi's wonderful cow, whose milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom"". She also gives him another letter with a command to kill him.
The son of seven queens goes to his bride's kingdom, who alter the second letter. The boy  meet the white hind queen's mother, who directs him to follow a road of 18,000 demons, but assuages him to have no fear. The boy takes the Jogi's cow and gives it to his mother and her co-queens.
Lastly, the white hind queen then suggests the boy brings the million-fold rice, that only ripens at night, and gives him a third letter. The boy passes by the princess's kingdom once again, and once again she alter the letter. The boy goes to the witch's hut and she directs him to the field, after a road swarming with 18 million demons. She warns him to get only the tallest ear, and to not look back. The boy walks to the rice fields, plucks the tallest ear, but looks behind him and becomes a pile of ashes.
The witch's mother goes to check on the boy and finds only a pile of ashes. She works to revive the boy back to life and scolds him. The boy returns with the million-fold rice to his seven mothers. With the million-fold rice, he and his seven mothers become the richest people in the kingdom, which expedites his marriage to the princess.
The princess asks her husband, the son of seven mothers, to build a replica of his father's palace, and invite the king. The king comes to his son's palace with the white hind queen and sees the seven queens sat on thrones. The princess, his daughter-in-law, throws herself at his feet and tells the whole story. The white hind's spell on him is broken and, back to sanity, the king orders the execution of the white hind queen, and restores the seven queens to his palace."

","A father is set to leave on voyage, but asks his four daughters what presents he can give them when he returns. The three elders say they want beautiful dresses, while the youngest asks for a peculiar present: a pigeon  that dances alone in a meadow.
The father finds the dresses in the trip, but still haven't found the pigeon, nor has found anyone who could give him information about it. After he reaches the border of a forest and sees the little bird. He tries to jump onto it to capture it, but a mysterious booming voice orders him to stop his action. The father tries to explain that the bird is a gift for his daughter, and even offers to buy it, but the voice - that belongs to a person named Asphor'ulehóa, the son of a teriel - refuses. Asphor'ulehóa relents and lets the man take the bird, and makes him promise to give him his youngest daughter for wife. The man knows that a teriel is a flesh-eater creature and fear for his daughter's life, but Asphor'ulehóa assures not harm shall be done to her, and tells him that he will come to their house in the shape of a camel.
The man returns and gives them the presents. When he is on his deathbed, he tells them that a camel shall appear. Some time later, the camel appears at their door. Every one of the four daughters climbs onto it, but it does not move. Only after the fourth daughter climbs onto it with the pigeon does the animal move and takes the girl to another place, already furnished. The girl notices someone comes to her bedroom every night and says she must not light any lamp.
Some time later, her sister visit her, and she tells them she has lived a comfortable life, but she has never seen the true face of Asphor'ulehóa. Her sisters convince her to spy on him when he comes at night. That night, she lights a candle and conceals it with a pot lid. Her husband comes to bed and falls asleep. She takes of the pot lid and raises her torch at him: Asphor'ulehóa is a beautfil youth. She also notices some little angels (""malaika"", in the original) near his body. The little angels tell her they are weaving a dress for Asphor'ulehóa's wife. Asphor'ulehóa wakes up with a startle and admonishes his wife for breaking his trust. He takes his garments and leaves in a hurry.
The girl follows after him, who hurries his steps towards his mother's house. When he arrives there, his human wife reaches him. Asphor'ulehóa tells her the place belongs to his mother, a teriel, who may devour her. So he lets her climb a nearby palm tree and tells her so stay there until his mother promises on his name not to do her any harm.
Asphor'ulehóa enters the house and his mother, the teriel, greets him. She says she will fetch some water to drink in a nearby fountain. She goes outside with a jar and sees the reflection of the girl in the water. Thinking there is a person in the water, she reaches into the reflected image to take it and devour it. She fails and breaks the jar. She goes home to get another jug and to try getting the girl she sees in the image. After some tries, she notices the girl on the tree and tries to convince her to climb down. The girl tells her she must first promise on her son's name not to harm her.
Asphor'ulehóa introduces the girl as his human wife. The next day, the teriel orders her to clean their wide courtyard as soon as she leaves, and not to leave any speckle of dust, otherwise she will devour her. The girl tells her husband about it; Asphor'ulehóa knocks on a rock to summon a large flood of water to clean up the courtyard in no time.
The next morning, the teriel mother orders her daughter-in-law to fill a cushion/pillow with feathers of all birds by nightfall. Asphor'ulehóa tells the girl to go up the hill and shout into the air that Asphor'ulehóa is sick and needs a pillow/cushion, and the birds shall appear to give her their feathers. The third task is for the girl to return every single feather to their original owner. Asphor'ulehóa tells her to go to the same hill, summon the birds, thank them for their help and return their feathers.
The next task is for her to separate water from milk that the teriel has mixed up. Asphor'ulehóa says they can't do it and admits his teriel mother has tried to kill her the past few days. That night, the teriel returns home and sees that the task was not done. Asphor'ulehóa tricks his mother to invite her sister for a feast with the girl as the main dish, but he hides his wife and roasts a bull. He opens up a pit in the dining room, fills it with fat and embers, and closes it with soil. He invites his mother and aunts to the dining room and directs them to stay on that spot. He reminds his mother of her oath and intends to enforce it: he commands the ground to open up and swallow the teriel and his aunts, who are consumed in the fire.
Asphor'ulehóa and his human wife leave the place forever and return to her father's house."

","Once upon time, there was an old woodcutter and his young son. The woodcutter always wanted his son to go to school but they didn't have enough money, and after a few years he had to come home. The son insisted on going to the woods to work with his father, but the father didn't think he could handle the hard work. During a lunch break, instead of resting, he defied his father and went wandering through the forest, where he heard a voice saying it was trapped at the bottom of the tree. There he saw a bottle, but when he opened it a giant demon sprang out and said it would break his neck and kill him. The young woodcutter then challenged the demon spirit, saying that it did not have the ability to get back in the bottle. So the spirit, to show that he really could do whatever he wanted, re-entered the bottle to show the boy how strong he was, and the boy stopped the bottle up again. The demon, shocked, began begging the woodcutter's son to open the bottle again, but he refused unless the spirit promised to benefit the boy.
The spirit pleaded with him and offered to make him rich. The boy decided it was worth the risk and released the demon. The spirit gave him a special cloth with one side that would turn any object into pure silver and the other side that would heal any wound. After turning his axe into silver, he tried to cut a tree in front of his father but bent the axe head. The father was extremely disappointed that he would have to replace the axe, which belonged to his neighbor. The boy went to sell the axe head and made 400 times more money than he needed to pay for the broken axe, and finally he told his father the story of the spirit in the bottle.
After that the father recognized that the boy's cleverness had made them rich and was happy. The boy went back to school to become a doctor and became one of the most successful and famous doctors with the help of his magical cloth that healed wounds."

One soldier stands on a single leg because, as he was the last one cast, there was not enough metal to make him whole. Nearby, the soldier spies a pretty paper ballerina with a spangle on her sash. She, too, is standing on one leg, and the soldier falls in love. That night, a goblin among the toys in the form of a jack-in-the-box, who also loves the ballerina, angrily warns the soldier to take his eyes off her, but the soldier ignores him.
The next day, the soldier falls from a windowsill (presumably the work of the goblin) and lands in the street. Two boys find the soldier, place him in a paper boat, and set him sailing in the gutter. The boat and its passenger wash into a storm drain, where a rat demands the soldier pay a toll.
Sailing on, the boat is washed into a canal, where the tin soldier is swallowed by a fish. When this fish is caught and cut open, the tin soldier finds himself once again on the table top before the ballerina. Inexplicably, the boy throws the tin soldier into the fire, which is most likely the work of the jack-in-the-box goblin. A wind blows the ballerina into the fire with him; she is consumed by it.

","A king calls his vizier to join him in visiting the city at night. They see a light in the distance and approach it. Inside, three women talk to each other: the first promises to bake a large pancake for the king and his army; the second that she can weave a tent large enough to accommodate the king and his army; and the third promises to bear the king twins, a boy and a girl with alternate hairs of gold and hyacinth (gold and jasper, in a Hungarian translation), and their laughter will make the sun and the moon appear, and when they weep the skies shall thunder and rain. (In a translation by E. A. Wallis Budge, the third woman says her daughter will have golden hair and her son ""hyacinthine locks"").The next day the king summons the three women and marries them. He sleeps with the first two on two separate nights, and they fail to deliver their promises. The third woman gives birth to a son and a daughter. The midwife is bribed by the other wives to replace the twins for two blind dogs and to cast them in a box into the river. The king sees the blind puppies and, feeling he was deceived, orders the woman to be tied to the stairs and covered with pitch, and for everyone to spit on her.
As for the twins, the box is saved by a fisherman who lives on an island. He and his wife raise the twins. Years pass, and one day, the fisherman takes the boy to the market to sell his fishes. The king passes by the market and sees the boy, named Muhammed. Sensing a strange connection to the boy, he pays the fishes and takes the boy with him to the palace. The king later sends the boy back to the fisherman. Meanwhile, the king's wife notices the boy is one of the children the midwife was supposed to kill. The midwife tells the king's wife not to worry, for she has a plan to get rid of the boy and his sister.
The midwife puts her plans into action: she goes to the fisherman's hut and finds the sister of the clever Muhammed (Muhammed the Discreet, in W. A. Clouston's translation) sitting alone. The woman goads the sister into sending Muhammed after the singing rose of a maiden named Arab-Zandiq. The boy rides until he reaches the house of an ogress, suckles her breasts and salutes her. The ogress tells him that his deed earned him her favour. After Muhammed talks about the singing rose, the ogress tells him about the garden where it is located: he is to exchange the fodder of a goat and a lion, then a gate will open, and he is to take the flower with him and flee before he becomes stone.
It happens as the ogress describes. Muhammed takes the rose back to his sister. Some time later, he visits the king again, and the midwife returns to the fisherman's hut: the rose will not sing unless the mirror is near it. The girl sends her brother to get the mirror. Muhammed goes back to he ogress, who this time advises him to go beyond the garden, up a staircase and find the mirror in a room.
The boy brings back the mirror. The midwife returns to the fisherman's hut and convinces the sister to ask for Arab-Zandiq herself. Muhammed goes back to the ogress, who warns him that many have tried to get her and failed, doomed to be turned into stone by her powers. Muhammed rides his horse to Arab-Zandiq's palace, puts his horse's head against a wall of the palace and shouts at the maiden's window for her to appear. Arab-Zandiq, from her window, tries to shoo away the boy, and the horse and him are slowly transformed into stone. The third time, Arab-Zandiq leans out of the window, her hair reaching the ground. Muhammed seizes the opportunity to pull her out of the window by her hair. Defeated, the maiden tells the boy she is destined for him, and disenchants the many stones in her palace.
Muhammed brings Arab-Zandiq with him to his sister. Arab-Zandiq orders her servants to build a palace in the fisherman's island, and tells Muhammed to invite the king to their new palace for his wedding with Arab-Zandiq. The king becomes impressed with the boy's palace and invites the boy, his wife and his sister to the royal palace.
So the three go to the royal palace. Arab-Zandiq sees the poor woman shackled to the stairs and covers her with a shawl. The king's servants take notice of this act of kindness and question the guest. Arab-Zandiq orders them to take the woman, bathe and cleanse her, and to provide her with new clothes. During the banquet with the king, the fisherman reveals he found the box with the twins in the river and raised the two. The twins' mother, brought to the banquet, recognizes her children by their hairs of hyacinth and gold. The king still wants them to prove their relationship, so they weep and thunders roar and it rains; they laugh, and the sun and the moon appear. The king celebrates that his family is reunited and burns his wife and the midwife."

","A king and queen had three daughters, and did everything to make them happy.  One day, the princesses asked to go on a picnic, and so they did.  When they were done eating, the princesses wandered about the garden, but when they stepped across a fence, a dark cloud enveloped them.  After a time, the King and Queen called for them, and then searched for them when the girls did not answer their calls.  The king proclaimed that whoever brought the princesses back could marry one, and would become the next king.  Two generals set out in search, but having spent all their money without finding the princesses, were forced to work as servants to repay an innkeeper for the food and drink he had given them.
A royal servant, Bensurdatu, set out, despite the king's unwillingness to lose a faithful servant as well as his daughters and his generals.  He found the inn with the generals and paid their debt.  The three of them traveled together.  In the wilderness, they found a house and begged for a place to stay for the night.  The old woman there told them that the king's daughters were taken by a thick cloud, and that two were the prisoners of giants and the third of a serpent with seven heads, all at the bottom of a river.  The generals wanted to return home to the King, but Bensurdatu was firm.
They went on until they reached the river.  The older general insisted on going first, because he was the oldest.  They lowered him on a rope, and gave him a bell to ring when he wanted to be pulled back up; he quickly lost his courage and rang it.  The second general fared the same.  Then they lowered Bensurdatu.  He came to a hall where a giant slept, and the princess stood before him.  The princess had him hide, and told the giant that he did not smell a man when he stirred from his sleep. She then had Bensurdatu cut off the giant's head.  The princess gave Bensurdatu a golden crown.  She showed him the door to the next giant, where he killed him as he had killed the first, and the second princess also gave him a golden crown.  He went on to the seven-headed serpent; he had to kill it while it was awake, but he took off its heads.
Had them lifted up.  The youngest wanted Bensurdatu to go before her, fearing the generals' treachery, but he refused; she pledged that she would marry no one else.  Then the generals did not lower the rope for him and threatened the princesses, to make them say that they had rescued them.  Believing the lie, the king agreed to marry the two oldest to the generals.
One morning, Bensurdatu noticed a purse.  When he took it down, it asked him what demands he had for his rescue.  He had it bring him to the surface and give him a ship.  He sailed to the king's city.  The king wanted to marry him to his youngest daughter, but she refused.  He asked if she would say the same if he were Bensurdatu.  She said nothing, and he told his story.  The king exiled the generals and married Bensurdatu to his youngest daughter."

It is related to the cycle of the Calumniated Wife, and is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 707, ""The Three Golden Children"".

","A childless king with six wives goes hunting in the woods and finds an emaciated-looking woman named ""Queen of the Forest"" atop a tree. The king and his retinue inquire about her nature: is she a devata, a rakshasa, a bhut, a Pret or human, like them? The woman climbs down the tree and eats a meal. The king takes her back to his palace and marries her. The other six queens become jealous. The Queen of the Forest is heavy with child and the king gives her a bell to ring to summon him. The Queen of the Forest gives birth to a boy that is replaced by a stone by the other queens and thrown to the buffalloes to be trampled. The animals, however, suckle the child and the queens throw the boy in a goat-shed. A woman that grazes the goats finds the boy (which she identifies as ""the Forest Queen son"") and she and her husband adopt him. Years later, the boy, named Lal, commissions a wooden horse to be made. He takes the boy to the river where the six queens were bathing and orders the wooden horse to drink water. The six queens mock the boy's action and he retorts about a human woman giving birth to a stone. The six queens notice it is their rival's son and return in a stunned state to the palace. The king learns of this and orders the boy to be summoned to his presence. The boy Lal tells his story and asks for the Queen of the Forest to be brought to them for a test: the woman is to be place behind a very thick screen; if she is Lal's biological mother, her milk will flow from her breasts and enter Lal's mouth. So it happens; the king recognizes him as his son, reinstates Lal's mother and banishes the six queens."

Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book.It is Aarne–Thompson type 531.  This type is generally called ""The Clever Horse,"" but is known in French as La Belle aux cheveux d'or, after this tale.  Other tales of this type include Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful, The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa, Corvetto, King Fortunatus's Golden Wig, and The Mermaid and the Boy.

","A princess was so beautiful and had such golden hair that she was known as Pretty Goldilocks. A neighboring king fell in love with her from her description, but much to the king's disappointment, she rejected his ambassador, saying she had no wish to be married.  A young courtier and royal favorite, called Charming, told his friends that if he had gone, she would have accepted, and the king threw him in prison.  He lamented his fate, and the king, hearing, told him what he had said was the cause of it.  Charming said that he would have drawn such a picture of the king as to make him irresistible to her, and the king decided to send him.  On the way, he helped a carp that was out of water, a raven being chased by an eagle, and an owl caught in a net; each one promised to help him.
When he attempted to bring his master's suit before the princess, she told him that she had lost a ring in the river and was so vexed that she would not listen to any suit unless the ambassador brought back her ring.  His dog, Frisk, advised him to try, and the carp brought him the ring.  When he brought it to Goldilocks, she told him that a giant who was a prince had tried to marry her and was troubling her subjects.  She could not listen unless he killed the giant.  He went to fight it, and with the raven's aid in pecking the giant's eyes during the fight, he succeeded.  Goldilocks refused unless he brought her some water from the Fountain of Health and Beauty, and the owl fetched the water for him.
The princess agreed then and made preparations to go and marry the king, although she at times wished they could stay, and she would marry Charming.  Charming refused to be disloyal to his king.
Goldilocks married the king but remained fond of Charming, and Charming's enemies told the king that she praised him so highly, he should be jealous.  The king had Charming thrown in a tower.  When Goldilocks begged for his freedom, the king refused, but decided to rub his face with the water from the Fountain of Health and Beauty to please her.  A maid had broken that bottle, though, and replaced it with another, not knowing the other bottle was actually a potent poison used for executing nobles by rubbing their faces with it.
Frisk came to the queen and asked her not to forget Charming, and the queen immediately released him and married him."

","Princess Zeineb narrates her tale in first person: she is the youngest of six daughters of King Batoche, who rules the eastern part of the Isle of Gilolo. One day, her father finds a palace in a part of the island. He enter, but a voice forbids him, threateninf to kill him unless he delivers of his daughters. The king returns to tell his daughters about the event, and they see a leopard with a ferocious glare in his eyes. That same day, the leopard appears at court; every daughter tries to gather some courage to offer herself to the leopard, but only Zeineb decides to bear the burden of her father's decision.
Zeineb goes to the leopard's palace and admires the extravagance. She is served by nymphs and the leopard is no animal, but shows great wisdom and respect for Zeineb. And so they live together in the palace. However, ten months into their domestic arrangement, Zeineb begins to suspect that the leopard may be more than he seems. One night, she notices that there is someone in bed with her, and the leopard skin is strewn about on the floor. Zeineb decides to tear the animal skin to pieces and goes back to bed.
Her mysterious bedmate wakes up the next day and despairs at the torn leopard fur. He reveals he is a king, enchanted by an evil magician. Zeineb tries to explain herself. The leopard begins to calm down and teaches her a magical spell to command people. Then, the princess notices that the palace and everything has disappeared. She finds some of her previous clothes, now in tatters, puts them on and decides to beg for food and work in the world. She meets a Mussulman trader who is travelling to Borneo, and embarks on his ship.
They reach Borneo and she disembarks. After walking to deeper parts of the island, the princess moves to the city of Soucad, where she decides to take up the job of seamstress. Her business thrives and she gains money enough to hire help and buy a larger studio. Due to her successes, three local men decide to try their luck in wooing her. The first of the would be seducers dines with Zeineb. The princess thinks of a ploy to get rid of him: she has a window in her apartment that the first suitor goes to shut, and the princess uses the magical command to glue him to the window until the morning. Similar incidents happen to the other two wooers.
Their passion for the princess turns to hatred and they report her to a judge, a magician. Zeineb manages to delay her trial for three months by bribing local magistrates, but she is still sentenced to be burnt alive. She is walked to her execution and the executioner prepared to deal the fatal blow, when he stays still - Zeineb is the one who paralyzed the executioner with the magical spell. The three suitors seize the opportunity to their favour and incite the populace. Suddenly, a great sound of acclamation is heard in the mob: the king of Soucad, their monarch, has returned, and wished to surprise his people. He halts the execution and releases the princess. After some moments taking in the visage of her saviour, she recognizes that the king of Soucad is the Leopard.
The king of Soucad, the same leopard, marries Zeineb and tells her the whole story: he is the legitimate heir to the throne, but his brother conspired  with a magician to turn him into an animal. A sage, however, mitigated the curse by establishing a escape clause: if a princess was willing to spend a whole year with him, the curse would be lifted."
the_story_of_t_m_and_c_m,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Tam_and_Cam,The Story of Tấm and Cám,The Story of Tấm and Cám (Vietnamese: Truyện Tấm Cám) commonly known as Tấm Cám (Chữ Nôm: 糝𥽇) is an ancient Vietnamese fairy tale. The first part of the tale's plot is very similar to the European folk tale Cinderella.,"The story is about two half-sisters; the eldest is named Tam (broken rice) and the youngest is named Cam (rice bran).[3] Tam's mother dies early and her father remarries before dying soon after. Tam lives with her stepmother, who is Cam's mother. The stepmother is very sadistic and makes Tam do all the housework, whereas Cam does not have to do anything.[3]

One day, the stepmother tells Tam and Cam to go to the field to catch ""tép"" (caridina, a tropical genus of shrimp) and promises to give them a new red yếm (a Vietnamese traditional bodice) to whomever catches the most.[3] Tam soon fills up her basket, while Cam plays in the water and catches nothing. Realizing that her sister actually had a chance at receiving a red yếm and the day is almost done, Cám comes up with a plan to sabotage Tam's work. Cam tells her older sister to wash her hair, saying that the stepmother will scold her if her hair is so muddy after catching all the caridinas, and Tam obeys. While Tam is washing her hair, Cam transfers all the shrimp from Tam's basket to hers and goes home.[3]

When Tam realizes that all the shrimp she has caught is gone, she cries in seeing all her hard work disappear and the impending punishment that will come from her stepmother. Bụt (a wise old man who helps pitiful people in Vietnamese folklore, sometimes considered a tiên) appears and asks why she cries, and she tells him what happened. He tells her to stop crying and see what is left in the basket, which is merely a goby. Then he tells her to raise the fish in a well with her rice and teach her the words to call the fish up:

O goby, o goby

Go up and eat my golden and silver rice

Don't eat those spoiled rice and porridge of theirs.

Without the exact recitement, the goby would not rise, according to what the old man has said before he vanishes. Tam follows his counsel, and the goby grows noticeably. Tam would spend her time talking to the goby about her thoughts, which the fish would silently comfort her. Suspicious about her behavior, the stepmother and the half-sister discover the fish as well as the poem by which Tấm summons it. The stepmother plans to distance Tam in order to kill the fish:

""My daughter, the village has prohibited using the field; tomorrow you should graze our buffaloes far away, or they shall seize them.""

The stepmother also tells Tam to leave her coat behind. Tam obeys her stepmother, unaware of her intent. The stepmother has Cam wear Tam's clothes and recite the line, making the goby mistaken her as Tam, which allows them to butcher the goby.

After coming back home, Tam calls the goby up as usual, but nothing goes up but blood. She sobs again and the old man appears again. He asks why she cries and she explains. He replies: ""Your goby they have eaten. Cry no more! Collect its bones, put them in four jars and bury them under your bed legs."", and she does so.

Soon after, the king hosts a festival, which he invites people from everywhere to attend, including Tam and her family. Noticing that Tam also wants to join, the stepmother mixes up the rice and bran that Tam has to separate them before joining the festival, and threatens to punish her if she does not have it done by the time they get back from the festival. Again she cries, but then the old man reappears and she explains what happened. He calls sparrows down to help her and teaches her a poem to prevent them from eating the bran and rice:

O sparrows, go down and separate these grains of rice for me

Eat a grain, and I will beat you to death

The old man then tells her to dig up those jars that she had buried previously. The first two jars includes silk clothes, a scarf, and a red yếm. The third jar contains a tiny horse which enlarges into a normal horse; the fourth has a saddle for the horse.

Happily, Tam washes up and wears the clothing before rushing to the festival in the capital. Crossing a stone bridge, she drops a slipper and cannot get it back.[4] When the king crosses the same bridge, the elephant on which the king rides suddenly growls and brushes its ivory down to the earth. Curiously, the king commands his men to look underwater, and they find the slipper. He observes the slipper for a while and comments that the shoe must belong to a gracious woman. Saying so, he tells all the women in the festival to try the slipper to find out the owner, whom he shall wed. No one fits the shoe. Tam arrives, excited about the festivities and notices her slipper on display. She approaches to try it on. Seeing Tam trying it on, Cam and her mother mock her. The slipper turns out to fit her, and she draws the other one to wear. The king commands his people to lead her to his palace to wed her. Tam goes with the king in front of Cam's and her mother's envious eyes."
the_story_of_three_wonderful_beggars,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Three_Wonderful_Beggars,The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars,"""The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars"" is a Serbian fairy tale. It is also known as Vasilii the Unlucky its Russian form, collected by Alexander Afanasyev in Narodnye russkie skazki.
Andrew Lang included The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars in The Violet Fairy Book.

","A very rich and hard-hearted merchant, Mark or Marko, had one daughter, Anastasia.  One day, he was about to set dogs on three beggars, when Anastasia pleaded with him.  He let them stay in the stable loft.  Anastasia went to see them.  In the Russian version, they were then grandly dressed; in both, they decided to give Marko's wealth to a new-born named Vasilii, the seventh son of a poor peasant in a nearby village.  She told her father.  He went and found just such a boy had been born.  He offered to be his godfather and then to raise the boy, giving the poor father a sum of money as well.  When the father agreed, the merchant threw the baby over a cliff.
Other merchants picked up the child and brought him to Marko, who persuaded them to leave him with them.  He put the boy in a barrel, or an open boat, and threw it into the sea.  It floated to a monastery, where the abbot took the child in.  Many years later, Marko passed by and heard the story.  He persuaded the abbot that he wanted to take him in, and that he would give a large sum to the monastery for it.  The abbot and monks agreed, and Marko sent him to his wife with a letter prescribing that he should be pushed into the soap-making cauldron at once.
Vasilii met the three beggars on the way, who breathed on the letter.  When he arrived, the letter called for him to marry Anastasia at once.  His wife obeyed, and Marko arrived to find a letter in his own handwriting calling for it.  So he sent his son-in-law to collect rent from Tsar Zmey (Serpent Emperor).
In the Serbian version, he met an old oak which asks if he can discover why it can't fall.  In both, he met a ferryman who asks if he can discover why he is bound to ferry people back and forth, and a whale being used as a bridge, which asks if he can discover how long it will be bound to this task.  
At the castle, he met a maiden, who hid him and asked the Serpent King or Tsar Zmey in serpent form, about a dream she had had.  He told her the oak had to be pushed over, which would reveal treasure, the ferryman had to push the boat off with another person in it, and the whale had to vomit up the twelve ships it had swallowed without leave.  He went back, carefully not telling the whale and the ferryman until he had already crossed.  In the Russian version, he received jewels from the whale; in the Serbian, he found gold and silver under the oak.  He returned to Marko, who set out to make sure the next time, Vasilii would not be able to escape, but the ferryman pushed the boat off, and Marko is ferrying people still. No harm then came to Vasilii and he lived in peace with Anastasia inheriting all the lands and treasures of Marko the Rich."

Andrew Lang included it in The Olive Fairy Book. The story was also featured in the book Once Long Ago, by Roger Lancelyn Green and illustrated by Vojtech Kubasta.

","In the middle of a wilderness, a beautiful mountain bore trees and waterfalls, but whoever left the road for it never returned.  A king advised his seven sons wisely, but no sooner had he died than his oldest son resolved to set out for the enchanted mountain. One after the other his sons departed for the mountain and never returned, until only the youngest remained, now king. Soon the craving to seek the mountain overcame him. The young king reached the mountain and was drawn away from his attendants by a deer which he could not catch; when he returned, he found all his men dead or dying of poison at their camp. He hid in the tree and saw a youth approaching.  This youth had servants dispose of the bodies and lead off the horses, but realized that there were one more horse than bodies and asked who owned the final horse. The young king leaped down and claimed ownership of the horse, challenging the youth to battle in revenge for his fallen brothers and servants—for surely this youth had caused his elder brothers to never return from the mountain.
The youth told the king he accepted the challenge and he was to follow him, Zoulvisia. When the youth mounted his horse and rode away, the young king realized that the youth had been a woman all along.  He set out to find her house. He came to three cottages, in each of which a fairy lived with her son. They urged him not to pursue Zoulvisia. He gave them a mirror, a pair of scissors, and a razor, telling them that if blood appeared on them, they should come to his aid.
Upon finding Zoulvisia's palace, he found an old man trapped in a pit outside the palace walls, who told him that Zoulvisia kept him prisoner there. He told how Zoulvisia could look over all her lands at sunrise, but if he hid in a certain cave, protecting it with a stick, he would survive and could come out on her third cry, having broken her power. He did that, and Zoulvisia admitted he had defeated her. She became his wife, freed the old man, and gave him her magical fiery horse.
One day, he hunted, having received a case of pearls with one of Zoulvisia's hair, and a stag led him far, and he lost the case in a river without realizing it. It was swept downstream, and a watercarrier found it and brought it to the wicked king of that land. Struck by its wealth and the beauty of the golden hair within the case, the wicked king demanded the chamberlain discover its secrets or the chamberlain would lose his head. In a fright, the chamberlain sought any who could explain the case and an old woman told the chamberlain that it belonged to a beautiful woman named Zoulvisia. The chamberlain told her that if she brought him Zoulvisia, he would give her more gold.
An old witch set off and arrived, on a raft, just as the king prepared to return to his wife from a day of hunting. He offered to help the witch, but his horse would not let him take her up, for it sensed her wickedness; she guessed why and said she feared falling off, so she would walk. When they arrived at the palace, the witch ingratiated herself with Zoulvisia's servants until the young queen trusted her. The witch persuaded Zoulvisia that her husband must be keeping a secret from her, the secret of his strength, and that he did not love her unless he would share it. Zoulvisia believed, and plead with her husband to know his secret, so that she would be sure that he loved her. He confessed the secret of his strength, a sabre that never left his side. To prove that her husband did indeed love her, Zoulvisia ran at once and confessed the secret to the witch, exactly as the witch had planned. The witch stole the sabre, struck the king down with poisonous snakes, and kidnapped Zoulvisia to sell the beautiful young queen to the wicked king.
The fairies' sons saw that something had happened to the young king. They went to his castle and could not find the sabre. They caught fish to eat, and a great fish thrashed in the water because it had eaten the sabre. They brought it to the king, who recovered. He set out on Zoulvisia's fiery horse. He found the place where the wicked king was going to marry Zoulvisia, though Zoulvisia greatly resisted him and wished to escape to her beloved husband. The young king had an old beggar woman bring his ring to Zoulvisia. She told the beggar woman to tell the wicked king that Zoulvisia had come to her senses and would marry him, and to tell the man who gave the ring to await her in a garden in three days.
The wicked king loosened the guard on her, and she went to the gardens on the day of her supposed wedding, unattended by the wicked king's guards. There, with a flash of fire and crack of thunder, the young king rode down on his fiery horse and rescued Zoulvisia, returning them both to her palace by the river to live happily ever after."

Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book.

","A widowed queen of the Flowery Isles had two daughters. The older of them was so beautiful that her mother feared that the Queen of all the Isles would be jealous of her; this queen required all princesses, at the age of fifteen, to appear before her and give homage to her beauty as transcendent. When the older princess arrived, the talk of the court was such that the queen of all the islands feigned illness in order to avoid meeting her and sent her home.
The mother obeyed and warned her daughter to stay inside for six months, to avoid the queen's magical powers. The daughter promised to obey, but as the time was drawing near, they prepared a feast to celebrate. The daughter asked permission to go so far as to see them, and got it; the earth opened up under her feet and swallowed her.
The princess found herself in a desert with a pretty little dog that led her to a lovely garden. It had water and fruit trees that would enable her to live. At nighttime, the dog pulled her to a cave with a bed. She lived there some time. One day, her dog seemed ill, and in the morning she went to look for him, and saw nothing but an old man hurrying away.  A cloud bore her away to her mother's castle, where she found that her mother had died days after her disappearance. Her younger sister tried to insist that she was queen, but she would only consent to share the crown.
She made a careful search for the dog throughout the land and offered to marry whoever brought it to her. A very ill-looking man did, but the princess said she could not marry without the consent of the land, and the council refused it. The queen obeyed, but declared she would abdicate and travel the land until she found the dog.
The next day, a great fleet arrived, and the Prince of the Emerald Isles appeared, telling her that he had been the dog, and then the old man, but now a benevolent fairy had freed him. The queen married him."

The tale was also included by Andrew Lang in The Blue Fairy Book (1889).
It is classified as its own Aarne–Thompson index type 326. It refers to tales of a male protagonist's unsuccessful attempts to learn how to feel fear.This tale type did not appear in any early literary collection but is heavily influenced by the medieval adventure of Sir Lancelot du Lac called Les Merveilles de Rigomer in which he spends a night in a haunted castle and undergoes almost the same ordeals as the youth.

","A father had two sons. The dimwitted younger son, when asked by his father what he would like to learn to support himself, said he would like to learn how to shudder (as in, learn to have fear). A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost. The boy demanded an explanation. When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.
His horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, ""If only I could shudder!""  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.
After the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.
The boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.
The first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.
As the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.
On his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.
The following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.
After their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints ""If only I could shudder!"" annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was."

It is Aarne-Thompson number 295.","An old woman has some beans that she intends to cook over her fire.  Being in a hurry, she grabs some straw to make the fire light faster.  She pours the beans in the pot and, being in a hurry, she drops one on the floor which lands next to a piece of straw.  Soon the fire is burning nicely and a hot coal jumps out and lands next to the straw and the bean.  They discuss that they have narrowly escaped the fire, and they band together to flee.
At a river, the straw lies down to let them cross.  The coal, being hot-tempered by nature, immediately sets across.  But when the coal is halfway across, the water rushes underneath, and the coal becomes terrified of being drowned.  So he stops, too afraid to go on.  The straw catches on fire from the coal and splitting in two, the straw and the coal are swept downstream.
The bean cannot help but laugh at the misfortune of his comrades, and indeed he laughs so hard that he bursts his side.  He is in trouble, but luckily there is a friendly tailor nearby who sews him back up with some black thread, and ever since beans have had a black seam."

Skazka o tsare Saltane, o syne yevo slavnom i moguchem bogatyre knyaze Gvidone Saltanoviche i o prekrasnoy tsarevne Lebedi listen ) is an 1831 fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin. As a folk tale it is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 707, ""The Three Golden Children"", for it being a variation of The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird.

","The story is about three sisters. The youngest is chosen by Tsar Saltan (Saltán) to be his wife. He orders the other two sisters to be his royal cook and weaver. They become jealous of their younger sister. When the tsar goes off to war, the tsaritsa gives birth to a son, Prince Gvidon (Gvidón). The older sisters arrange to have the tsaritsa and the child sealed in a barrel and thrown into the sea.
The sea takes pity on them and casts them on the shore of a remote island, Buyan. The son, having quickly grown while in the barrel, goes hunting. He ends up saving an enchanted swan from a kite bird.
The swan creates a city for Prince Gvidon to rule, which some merchants, on the way to Tsar Saltan's court, admire and go to tell Tsar Saltan. Gvidon is homesick, so the swan turns him into a mosquito to help him. In this guise, he visits Tsar Saltan's court. In his court, his middle aunt scoffs at the merchant's narration about the city in Buyan, and describes a more interesting sight: in an oak lives a squirrel that sings songs and cracks nuts with a golden shell and kernel of emerald. Gvidon, as a mosquito, stings his aunt in the eye and escapes.
Back in his realm, the swan gives Gvidon the magical squirrel. But he continues to pine for home, so the swan transforms him again, this time into a fly. In this guise Prince Gvidon visits Saltan's court again and overhears his elder aunt telling the merchants about an army of 33 men led by one Chernomor that march in the sea. Gvidon stings his older aunt in the eye and flies back to Buyan. He informs the swan of the 33 ""sea-knights"", and the swan tells him they are her brothers. They march out of the sea, promise to be guards and watchmen of Gvidon's city, and vanish.
The third time, the Prince is transformed into a bumblebee and flies to his father's court. There, his maternal grandmother tells the merchants about a beautiful princess that outshine both the sun in the morning and the moon at night, with crescent moons in her braids and a star on her brow. Gvidon stings her nose and flies back to Buyan.
Back to Buyan, he sighs over not having a bride. The swan inquires the reason, and Gvidon explains about the beautiful princess his grandmother described. The swan promises to find him the maiden and bids him await until the next day. The next day, the swan reveals she is the same princess his grandmother described and turns into a human princess. Gvidon takes her to his mother and introduces her as his bride. His mother gives her blessing to the couple and they are wed.
At the end of the tale, the merchants go to Tsar Saltan's court and, impressed by their narration, decides to visit this fabled island kingdom at once, despite protests from his sisters- and mother-in-law. He and the court sail away to Buyan, and are welcomed by Gvidon. The prince guides Saltan to meet his lost Tsaritsa, Gvidon's mother, and discovers her family's ruse. He is overjoyed to find his newly married son and daughter-in-law."
tale_of_the_doomed_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Doomed_Prince,Tale of the Doomed Prince,"The ""Tale of the Doomed Prince"" is an ancient Egyptian story, dating to the 18th Dynasty, written in hieratic text, which survived partially on the verso of Papyrus Harris 500 currently housed in the British Museum. The papyrus was burned in an explosion; because of this damage the conclusion of the story is missing. Some scholars speculate that the missing ending was mostly likely a happy one and that the tale could be more aptly named ""The Prince who was Threatened by Three Fates"" or the like.There are dozens of translations of this story from a wide variety of scholars. The translations by Miriam Lichtheim and William Kelly Simpson from the 1970s are both widely accepted versions.

","The story goes as follows: The king of Egypt was very sad that a son had not yet been born to him. The king prays to the gods, and that night his wife conceives a child. When the king's son is born the seven Hathors (goddesses, who pronounce the fate of each child at birth) foretell that he will die either by crocodile, snake or dog. His father, afraid for his son’s safety, builds his son an isolated palace in the mountains, so as to keep him away from danger.
One day the prince sees from his palace a man with a dog. He asks his father for a dog. The king warily gives the prince a dog, not wishing his son to be unhappy. When the prince grows up, he decides to face his doom, travelling abroad to Nahrin. There he meets a group of young men competing for the heart of the princess. The prince succeeds in winning the heart of a princess by jumping (possibly flying) to the window of the room where the princess is locked up. The prince did not tell the king the truth about himself, but said he was the son of a charioteer, and explained that he had had to leave home because of his new stepmother. Eventually the king agrees to let the prince-in-disguise marry his daughter, after seeing the merits of the young man.
After marrying the princess he tells her of his three dooms, and of his prince-hood. She urges him to kill the dog, but the prince cannot bear to kill the dog he has raised from a puppy. His wife watches over him dutifully, and stops a snake from biting the prince in his sleep. Thus, one of the prince’s fates is defeated. Some time after that the prince goes for a walk with his dog. The dog begins speaking (the dog possibly bites the prince), and tells the prince he is meant to be killed by the dog. Fleeing from the dog, he runs to a lake where he is seized by a crocodile who, instead of killing him, enlists his help in its fight against a demon (or a water spirit). [This is where the tale breaks off]."

The girl asks to be taken to that place. The three women arrive, and see a hen singing a joyous tune, while the man appears on his ship, still lamenting over his secret. The girl goes to him and asks for his forgiveness. He explains he is a king, and that his mother wants to marry him to a princess.
The man then takes the human girl to meet his mother. He tells her she is a servant, and the mother forces the girl to do chores for her son's upcoming wedding: to separate a heap of mixed cereals (beans, wheat, corn and barley) and to clean her palace with a beaded cloth and a broom decorated with pearls and emeralds. For the first task, the king whistles and the birds come to separate the cereal grains for her, and commands his servants to clean the palace instead of her. His mother later talks to him in private about the girl, and he reveals the whole story. The mother admits that, if he loves her, and she loves him, she sees no problem in signing the marriage contract between them. They celebrate their wedding."

","A king had thirteen sons.  One day, he saw a swan driving away one of its thirteen cygnets, and a seer explained that any man or beast with thirteen young should drive one away, to fall under Heaven's will.  The king could not bear to choose one of his sons.  The seer said he should shut the door on the last son to return that night.  This was the oldest, Seán Ruadh.  He asked his father for an outfit for the road, and the king gave him it and a black horse that could run faster than the wind.
One day, he put on some poor clothing and was hired by a king to herd his cows.  The king also told him that an urfeist, a sea serpent, demanded a king's daughter every seven years, and this year the lot had fallen on his own daughter.  Many king's sons said they would save her, but her father did not believe them.  The sea serpent would appear one day, he did not know when.
Three giants lived near the king's lands.  Seán Ruadh pastured the cows on their lands, and fought with them, one per day.  They promised their swords of light and horses if he would spare them, but he killed them, and their housekeepers, glad to be freed, showed him all their treasures.  Each day the cows gave more milk than they ever had before.
On the fourth day, he dressed in the black clothing of the first giant, took its black horse, and went down the shore.  The princess awaited the sea serpent there.  Seán Ruadh asked her to take his head in her lap until it arrived; then she should wake him.  She took it, took three hairs from his head, and woke him when the sea serpent arrived.  They fought.  Seán Ruadh cut off its head, but it instantly grew back.  The sea serpent left, but said it would return.
The next day, he wore the blue clothing of the second giant and rode its brown horse, but when he laid down as before, the princess compared his hair to the three hairs and noted he was the same knight as the first one.  He cut the sea serpent in half, but the halves joined again, and it threatened that no one would save her the third day.
The third day, he wore the many-colored clothing of the third giant, with its blue glass boots, and rode its red horse.  When he was dressed the housekeeper told him that no one could fight the sea serpent that day; the only way to defeat him was to throw the brown apple she gave him down its open mouth.  He took it.  Again, the princess knew him by the hairs.  He threw the brown apple, and the sea serpent melted away into jelly.  The princess grabbed his boots and one came off.  He had to leave it with her.
Many men claimed to be the hero, but a seer said they must all try on the boot.  Finally, every man had tried it except the cowherd.  They sent twenty men for him, but he overpowered them; when they sent another twenty, he overpowered them as well; finally, the seer told the king to go himself, and when the king asked and told him not to mind his work, Seán Ruadh came.  The boot fitted on of its own.  The princess jumped to his arms.  He was told that the men swarming about had claimed to have saved her, and he cut off all their heads.  Then he married the princess at a great wedding feast and took her with him to the giants' lands."

One noticed that he had a horse's foot, but though he was the Devil, he assured them that he only wanted a soul that was already half his and not theirs. He gave them money and told them that, whenever they were spoken to, the first one was to say ""All three of us""; the second, ""For money""; and the third, ""And quite right too!""
They went and lived in an inn. The innkeeper thought they were mad, and they saw everything that happened there. A merchant gave the innkeeper money to take care of, for fear the apprentices would steal it. The innkeeper murdered the merchant in the night and blamed the apprentices; their answers to the questions seemed confessions of guilt, but the Devil appeared as they were about to be executed and freed them. They then announced that the innkeeper was the murderer, and where the bodies were to be found. The innkeeper was executed, the Devil got his soul, and the three apprentices had money for the rest of their lives."

","A childless king heard a voice asking him whether he would rather have a daughter who would flee him or a son who would destroy him.  After consulting his wise men, who argued over whether the danger to life or honor was the worse, he concluded that the daughter would be less harmful to his realm; he went back to the garden and answered the voice that he wanted the daughter.  She was born, and her father tried to shelter her in a castle, but when she was fifteen, he concluded a marriage for her.  When she left to go to her husband, a whirlwind carried her off.
The wind left her at an ogress's house in the forest.  An old woman there warned her of the danger, saying the ogress did not eat her only because she needed a servant and the old woman was old and tough; she gave the princess the keys, to go inside and clean the house perfectly, which was her only chance.  The princess, Marchetta, cleaned the house.  When the ogress returned, the old woman hid Marchetta and claimed the credit.  When the ogress left again, the old woman fed Marchetta and told her to prepare a very fine dinner to charm her, warning her that if the ogress swore by all the seven heavens, she was not to be trusted; only her oath by her three crowns was trustworthy.  The ogress praised the dinner and made many fine oaths about what she would do for the cook, but only when she swore by her three crowns did Marchetta come out.  The ogress said that Marchetta had outsmarted her and could live in the castle as if it were her own; she gave her the keys and warned her against opening one doorway.  One day Marchetta opened it and found three women dressed in gold, sitting on thrones, asleep; these were the ogress's daughters, whom she kept there because they would be in danger if not woken by a king's daughter.  They woke, Marchetta fed them each an egg, and the ogress returned.  Angry, she slapped Marchetta; then she tried to appease her, but Marchetta insisted on leaving.  The ogress gave her a suit of men's clothes and a magic ring, which she should wear with the stone turned inside.  If she were ever in great danger, and heard the ogress's name like an echo, she should look at the stone, but not until then.
Marchetta went to the king and, claiming to be a merchant's son driven out by his wicked stepmother's cruelty, took service as a page.  The queen, believing her to be male, desired her as a lover and propositioned her.  Marchetta, not wishing to reveal that she was a woman, said that she could not believe that the queen would cuckold the king.  The queen told the king that the page had tried to seduce her.  The king immediately condemned Marchetta to death.  Marchetta lamented her fate and asked who would help her; the echo said, ""The ogress""; Marchetta remembered the stone and looked at it.  A voice proclaimed that she was a woman, shocking her guards.  The king demanded her story, and Marchetta gave it.  The king had his wife thrown into the sea, invited Marchetta's parents to his court, and married her."

","A dying peasant told his son and daughter that he had only his house and three sheep to leave them; they could divide them as they wished, but must not quarrel. The brother asked his sister which she wished to have. She chose the house.  He told her he would take the sheep and seek his fortune. He met a stranger who offered to trade three dogs for his sheep:  Salt, which would bring him food; Pepper, who would tear attackers to pieces; Mustard, which could break iron or steel with its teeth. The brother agreed and once the trade was done, asked Salt for food; it instantly gave him some.
He went on and found a town draped in black. There, he heard that a dragon demanded the tribute of a maiden every year, and this year the lot had fallen on the princess. He went to where she was left, and set Pepper on the dragon. The dog swallowed it all except for two teeth, which the man pocketed. The princess offered to marry him. The man said he wanted to see the world, and would return in three years. When she was being driven back, the coachman told her that her rescuer was gone and he would kill her if she did not say that he had killed the dragon. She promised. The king said he would marry her to him, but he put off the marriage a year, because she was so young. At the end of the year, she begged him to put it off another, and again, for a third year. Then the wedding date was set.
The man returned, but when he said he had killed the dragon, he was thrown into prison. He called Mustard, which ate through the bars. Then he sent Salt for food.

","An envious widow, Caradonia, had an ugly daughter, Grannizia.  She married a rich landowner with a lovely daughter, Cicella, and in her envy tormented her stepdaughter, dressing her badly, giving her poor food, and making her work.  One day, Cicella dropped her basket over a cliff.  She saw, below, a hideous ogre and politely asked him to help her.  He said if she climbed, she would get it.  She climbed down and found three beautiful fairies at the bottom of the cliff.   She was polite with them, combing their hair and claiming to find pearls and rubies along with lice.  They took her to their castle and showed her their treasures; she admired them but was not bedazzled.  Finally, they showed her rich clothing and asked her to choose a dress; she chose a cheap one.  They asked her how she wanted to leave, and she said the stable door was good enough for her.  They gave her a splendid gown, dressed her hair, and brought her to a golden door, telling her to look up when she went through it.  A star fell on her forehead.
Grannizia went to the same place and was rude, complaining of the lice in their hair.  They brought her to the wardrobe, and she grabbed the fanciest dress.  They did not give it to her, but sent her out the stable door, where a donkey's testicle fell on her forehead.  Her furious mother took Cicella's clothing and gave it to Grannizia, and sent Cicella to tend pigs.  There, a nobleman, Cuosemo, saw her and asked her stepmother for leave to marry her.  Caradonia agreed, sealed up Cicella in a barrel, and presented Grannizia as the bride instead.  After the wedding night, he went back to the house, and a tabby cat told him that Cicella was in the barrel.  He let her out, put Grannizia in her place, and fled with her.  Caradonia returned with wood, created a fire, and boiled water to scald Cicella to death.  She poured it in the barrel.

","A count's only son could learn nothing. Three times the count sent him for a year to famous masters. Each time, the son came back: saying first that he knew what dogs said when they barked; the next time, what birds said; and finally, what frogs said. Infuriated by his uselessness, his father ordered his people to take him to the woods and kill him, but they sympathised with him, and instead brought the count the eyes and tongue of a deer as proof of his death.

On his wanderings, he liberated an area from haunting by dogs, by raising a treasure from under a tower, which he could do because he understood their language. The lord of the castle asked him to do so, and he came out with a chest of gold, and the lord adopted him as a son.
He went to Rome. In Rome, the Pope had died, and the cardinals wanted him as the Pope's successor, as two doves had sat on his shoulders as a divine sign. On his journey, listening to the frogs had made him sad and thoughtful. He consented to his appointment, as the doves advised him to do. When he had to read Mass, the doves whispered how to do it in his ear."
the_three_little_birds,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Little_Birds,The Three Little Birds,"""The Three Little Birds"" (German: De drei Vügelkens) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 96. The story is originally written in Low German. It is Aarne-Thompson type 707, the dancing water, the singing apple, and the speaking bird. The story resembles Ancilotto, King of Provino, by Giovanni Francesco Straparola, and The Sisters Envious of Their Cadette, the story of the 756th night of the Arabian Nights.

","Three sisters were tending cows when a king and his company went by. The oldest pointed at the king and said she would marry him or no one; her sisters pointed at the ministers and said the same. The king summoned them before him, and then, because they were very beautiful, he married the oldest and his ministers married the youngest.
The King had to go on a journey, and had her sisters attend the queen. She gave birth to a son with a red star on his forehead. Her sisters threw the baby boy into the water, and a bird sprang out of the water singing of what they had done. Despite the bird terrifying them, the sisters told the king that the Queen had given birth to a dog. Little did everyone know, a fisherman fished the boy out of the water and raised him. The King said that whatever God had sent was good. It happened again with their second son, and sadly their third child, the King and Queen's daughter. However, instead of saying the Queen had given birth to a third dog, the sisters said that she had given birth to a cat. This forced the Kings hand and he threw his wife into a prison as punishment.
One day, the other boys would not let the oldest fish with them, because he was a foundling. So he set out to find his father. He found an old woman fishing and told her she would fish long before she caught anything. She told him that he would search long before he found his father, and carried him over the water to do it. The next year, the second boy set out in search of the brother, and he fared the same as his brother had. The next year, the girl set out as well, and when she found the woman, she said ""May God bless your fishing."" The old woman gave her a rod and told her to go to a castle, bring back a caged bird and a glass of water, and on the way back, strike a black dog with the rod.  She did it, found her brothers on the way, and when she struck the dog, turned it into a handsome prince. They went back home to the fisherman.
The second son went hunting and, when he grew tired, played a flute. The king heard this and found him.  He did not believe he was the fisherman's son, so the second son invited him home. There, the bird sang the story of what happened to them. The queen was let out of prison, the lying sisters were killed, and the daughter was married to the prince."

It is Aarne-Thompson type 403B (""The Black and the White Bride""), with an episode of type 480 (""The Kind and the Unkind Girls"").

","A woman offers her hand in marriage to a widower: in return, her daughter would wash and drink water, and the man's daughter would wash with milk and drink wine. After performing a test to determine his choice, he marries the woman, who keeps her word. However, by the second day of marriage, both daughters bathe and wash with water. By the third, the man's daughter washes with and drinks water, while the woman's daughter drinks wine and washes with milk. It remains this way afterwards, because the woman secretly hates her step-daughter due to her being prettier than her own.
One day during winter, the step-mother makes her step-daughter put on a paper dress and go out to find strawberries. The girl is horrified by this, as no fruit can be found in winter and the dress will not protect her from the cold. The step-mother forces her to go out, forbidding her return until strawberries are brought. In reality, this is a plot to get rid of the girl due to the step-mother's immense hatred of her. The girl soon finds a small house with three little men inside. She shows great kindness towards them as a houseguest, offers them her coarse food given by the step-mother, and cleans house for them also. The men, feeling sorry for her circumstances, decide to give her three gifts: she will grow prettier every day, gold will fall from her mouth at every word, and she will one day marry a king. The girl eventually finds strawberries near the back of their house and makes her way home happily.
The girl returns home, but faces the envy of her step-sister, who wants the same rewards. Her mother initially doesn't let her search for strawberries, but the step-sister begs until she is allowed. She is given a warm coat and good food, and soon finds the house with the three little men. However, she acts rudely towards them and refuses to clean. When she realizes she won't be given anything, she takes her leave. The three men decide to punish her for her behavior: the girl will grow uglier every day, toads will jump out from her mouth at every word, and she will die a horrible death. The step-sister returns home unhappily, and her mother is disgusted by the toads that come out of her mouth.
The step-mother's hatred for her step-daughter increases day by day due to her becoming more beautiful. She dips yarn into boiling water and gives the girl an axe to cut a hole in an iced river to rinse it. During the time she is doing so, a king arrives in his coach and is infatuated with her beauty. He takes her along to his castle and marries her as the three men had foretold. Soon after, she has a baby boy. However, the step-mother hears of this and arrives with her daughter, pretending to visit. When they are alone, they both seize the queen and toss her out the window, where she falls into a stream and drowns. The woman's daughter is immediately given the place of the queen, and the king is told she is sick, so toads now come from her mouth instead of gold.
During the night, the kitchen-boy witnesses a duck swim up the gutter and ask for the statuses of the king and baby. The boy answers they sleep quietly. The duck temporarily turns into the queen to care for her baby and swims off as a duck through the gutter. This happens again two more times: on the third, she tells the kitchen-boy to tell the king to brandish his sword over her three times. The boy tells the king, who does so, and the duck turns back into the queen, who comes back to life.
The king hides his wife during his child's baptism to confront the step-mother and false queen. He asks the step-mother what the punishment should be for someone who drags another from bed and drowns them: the woman foolishly answers that they should be placed in a cask with nails inside and rolled down a hill into the water. The king then exclaims she has just spoken her own sentence, so the step-mother and false queen are then put inside said cask and rolled down a hill into a nearby river."
the_three_may_peaches,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_May_Peaches,The Three May Peaches,"The Three May Peaches (French: Les Trois pêches de mai) is a French fairy tale collected by Paul Delarue. He collected more than thirty French types of this tale, which is known in Europe, North Africa, and Asia as far as India.It is Aarne-Thompson type 570, the Rabbit Herd.It opens with Aarne-Thompson type 610, Fruit to Cure the Princess, which is seldom a stand-alone plot; it combines with the Rabbit Herd, as in this, or with type 461, Three Hairs from the Devil, as in The Griffin.

","A king of Ardenne had a beautiful daughter who was sick. A doctor declared that the three finest May peaches would save her, but then she would have to marry within a week or fall sick again.  Many men came with peaches, but none saved the princess.  A woman had three sons, and the oldest set out with the finest peaches from their orchard.  He met an old woman who asked what he had; he claimed rabbit dung, she said that so it was, and when he got the castle, that was what he carried.  His next brother set out next, told the old woman he carried horse dung, and again found that was what he carried.  The youngest, who was short and regarded as a little simple, persuaded his mother to let him try as well, and told the old woman that he carried the peaches to cure the princess, and she said so it was and also gave him a silver whistle.  When he got to the castle, eating the peaches revived the princess.
The king did not want such a puny little son-in-law.  He told the boy had to herd a hundred rabbits and not lose one for four days.  The first day, the rabbits scattered, but the boy used the whistle to bring them back.  The second day, the king sent the princess to get one; the boy would only trade one for a kiss, and when she had it and had reached the gates of the castle, he used the whistle, and it came back.  The next day, the king sent the queen to get one; the boy would only trade one if the queen turned three somersaults, and when she did, the king locked it in a room but the boy used his whistle and it came back through a window.  The fourth day, the king went himself.  The boy would only trade it if the king kissed his donkey's behind.  When the king had gotten the rabbit, he had it killed and skinned and put on to casserole, but the boy used his whistle and it jumped out of the dish, back into its skin, and back to the boy.
Then the king said that the boy had to fill three sacks with truths.  He said the princess had kissed him for a rabbit, and that filled the first sack; the queen had turned somersaults for a rabbit, and that filled the second.  The king stopped him and let him marry the princess."

The actual source was Von den drei Brüdern und ihren Thieren from August Leskien und K. Brugman, in Litauische Volkslieder und Märchen (1882).

","Three princes had a stepsister. The four went hunting one day and were about to shoot a wolf when it offered to give each prince a cub if they did not. The same thing happened with a lioness, a fox, a hare, a boar and a bear. Then they came to a crossroads. The oldest told his brothers to each mark a birch there:  if they returned and saw blood flowing, they would know that that brother was dead, but if milk flowed, he was alive.  Then they asked their stepsister which one she wanted to go with; she went with the oldest.
The oldest prince found a den of robbers. With the aid of his beasts, he killed all but one, who feigned death. He and his stepsister spent the night there. The next day, he went hunting. The surviving robber forced the stepsister to bring him magical potions that healed him, and had her trick her brother into letting her tie his hands behind his back. It was a test of his strength and required three cords. On the third, the robber appeared, brandishing a knife. The prince tricked the robber into letting him blow his horn. The animals came and killed the robber. He chained his stepsister to the wall to let her repent, and put a great bowl before her, telling her he would not see her until she filled it with her tears.
The princess was about to be handed over to a dragon. The oldest prince went to the seashore where she was to be handed over and with his animals killed the dragon. The princess had him come into the coach to drive back to the castle and gave him a ring and half of her handkerchief. But the coachman and footman killed him to claim they had killed the dragon. The animals gathered around the body. Then the wolf had an idea. It killed an ox and set the fox as a guard over it. It caught a crow, and the lion told it they would not kill it if it got them the waters to revive the prince. It did so, and the prince went to the town. The princess was to marry the coachman, but the prince proved himself the dragon-slayer by the ring and the handkerchief, so the coachman was thrown in prison and the prince married the princess.
One day he went hunting and lost his way. He asked a witch if he might stay the night, but she claimed to fear his animals and asked to touch them with a rod. He agreed, but it turned them, and him, into stone. The youngest brother returned to the crossroads and saw that ill had befallen his oldest brother. He went down that road, and the people of the town took him for their prince. The princess knew he was not her husband and begged him to find the prince. He went, found the same witch, and suffered the same fate.
The second brother returned to the crossroads and saw that ill had befallen both his brothers. He went down the same road as his oldest brother, and again only the princess knew who he was. He went out to search, found the witch, but told her that only he could strike his animals. She gave him the rod, and he touched the fox with it, and he saw it turned it to stone. Then he threatened her with his animals unless she restored his brothers, so she did so and they returned to the town."

Scottish poet and novelist  Andrew Lang collected it his The Red Fairy Book (1890).

","A fisherman caught nothing one day, and near evening, a head popped up from the water, to make a bargain for him:  fish for what his wife carried under her girdle.  When he returned home, his wife told him that she was pregnant and the baby was what he had offered.  The king heard of their story and offered to raise their son when he was born, to protect him, but when the boy was grown, he begged to go with his father fishing for one day, and as soon as he set foot in the boat, it was dragged off to a far land.
He met an old man, who told him that he had come to Whiteland.  If he walked down the shore, he would come to three princesses buried up to their necks in sand.  If he passed by the first two and spoke to the third, the youngest, it would bring him good luck.
The youngest princess told him that three trolls had imprisoned them there.  If he went up into the castle by the shore and let each troll beat him for one night, the princesses would be freed.  A flask of ointment by the bed there would cure all the injuries he suffered, and a sword would let him cut off their heads.
The first troll had three heads and three rods, and when he had suffered the princesses stood in the sand up to their waists; the second had six heads and six rods, and the princesses stood in sand up to their knees; the third had nine heads and nine rods, and beat him so severely that he could not reach for the ointment, but it threw him against the wall, and the flask broke, spilling ointment on him, and he killed it, freeing the princesses entirely.
He married the youngest and lived happily with her for several years, but at the end of them, he wanted to visit his parents.  His wife finally agreed but told him that he must do only what his father asks, not what his mother wishes, and gave him a ring that would grant two wishes, one to go home and one to return.  He went, and his mother wanted to show him to the king.  His father said not to, but in the end she had her way, and while at the king's, he wished that his wife was there to compare to the king's.  That summoned his wife and used up his second wish.  Sadly, his wife took the ring, knotted a ring with her name on it in his hair, and wished herself home again.

He decided to see if he could reach Whiteland on his own and set out.  He came to the king of all the animals and asked if he knew the way.  He did not, and neither did all the animals when he summoned them, so the king lent the man a pair of snowshoes to reach his brother, who was the king of all the birds.  The king of the birds did not know, and neither did the birds, so that king lent him a pair of snowshoes to reach his brother, the king of all the fish.  The third king did not know, but an old pike, the last of all the fish to arrive, knew the way and that his wife was to remarry the next day.
The king sent him to a field where three brothers had fought for a hundred years over a magical hat, cloak, and pair of boots, which would let the wearer make himself invisible and wish himself wherever he wanted.  He tricked the brothers into letting him try them and set out to Whiteland.  He met the North Wind on the way, and it promised to storm the castle as if to blow it down when it reached the land after him. He arrived, and the North Wind carried off the new bridegroom.  His wife recognized him by the ring in his hair."

It is Aarne–Thompson type 501, which is widespread throughout Europe.It has obvious parallels to Rumpelstiltskin and Frau Holle, and obvious differences, so that they are often compared.Giambattista Basile includes an Italian literary fairy tale, The Seven Little Pork Rinds, in his 1634 work, the Pentamerone.
Italo Calvino's Italian Folktales includes a variant, And Seven!.The first edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales contained a much shorter variant, Hateful Flax Spinning, but it is ""The Three Spinners"" that became well-known.

","Once there was a beautiful-but-lazy girl named Sarah who would not spin. While her mother beats her for it, the Queen, passing by, overhears and asks the reason for the punishment. Ashamed to admit that Sarah is lazy, the woman replies that Sarah spins so much that her mother cannot afford to buy enough flax to keep her occupied. The Queen, impressed by such industry, offers to take Sarah with her.
Once at the castle, the queen takes the girl to a room filled with flax. If she spins it all within three days, she'll be rewarded with marriage to the queen's oldest son. Two days later, the queen returns and is amazed to find the flax untouched. The Sarah pleads that homesickness has kept her from spinning, but she realizes that excuse will not serve her twice.
Three women appear in the room that night. One has a grotesquely swollen foot; the second, an overgrown thumb; the third, a pendulous lip. They offer to spin all the flax for the girl if she will invite them to her wedding, introduce them as her aunts, and seat them at the high table. She agrees, and they commence and complete the spinning.
In the morning, the queen is satisfied to see the flax all spun. She arranges for the wedding to her son, the prince, and the girl asks to invite her ""aunts"". When they appear, the king asks how they came to have such deformities, and the three explain that they come from their years of spinning-the foot from treading, the lip from licking, and the thumb from twisting thread. The king forbids his beautiful daughter-in-law to spin again."
the_three_treasures_of_the_giants,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Treasures_of_the_Giants,The Three Treasures of the Giants,"The Three Treasures of the Giants is a Slavonic fairy tale collected by Louis Léger in Contes Populaires Slaves.  Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book.  Ruth Manning-Sanders included it as ""King Johnny"" in A Book of Giants.","A man had three sons.  When he was dying, he told his oldest that he would inherit, but must be kind to his mother and his younger brothers; he then gave the older two more advice, and told the youngest son that while he was not clever, he had a kind heart and should follow it. 
After he died, the sons set out to seek their fortune; the older two wanted to leave the youngest behind, but their mother said there was nothing for him there.  The older two carried great sacks of food, the youngest nothing, and the older two grew angry that they had to carry the weight.  The youngest rebuked them for claiming not to want to burden their mother, when they took all her food.  They shared with him.  At night, they ate on their own, and the family of the woodcutter shared with the youngest, so that he ate better than they did.  They set out to lose him in the wood and found a castle.  It was empty of people but had a room filled with copper coins, another with silver, and a third with gold, and the two older emptied their sacks at each room to fill them up.  When the youngest ate the food they had dropped, they drove him off and returned to their mother with the money.  
The youngest went back to the castle and made a bag of his jacket to take some gold.  The giants returned and caught him.  They told him they would spare him if he guarded their treasures, and gave him a table to feed himself at; if he knocked on it, it gave him a feast.  One day he grew tired of guarding and went off, taking the table.  He found a hermit and gave him a feast; the hermit offered to trade the table for a trumpet that would bring him an army when he blew it.  The youngest son agreed, but when he went on his way, he regretted it, blew the trumpet, and had the soldiers take back the table.  He went on and found another hermit; after another feast, the hermit offered him a bag that contained as many castles as he liked.  He agreed, but again had the soldiers take back the table.  
Going back home, he stayed with his brothers a time, and the secret leaked out.  The king borrowed the table, and tried to substitute a false one.  The youngest son used the trumpet and the king offered to give back the table and let him marry the princess.  He agreed.  When he produced a castle to live in, the king said he was old and weak and made him king.
In Lang's variant, the youngest son lived to be old and happy, but his descendants were too proud to look after the treasure and so were overcome.
In Manning-Sanders's, the hermits arrived and demanded the table; because they could not both take it to their hermitages, the princess proposed that they remain at the castle and eat there every day.  This made the son feel guilty, so he went back to offer it to the giants, who told them they did not want it, because it made food for men."
the_tiger__the_brahmin_and_the_jackal,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tiger,_the_Brahmin_and_the_Jackal","The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal","The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal is a popular Indian folklore with a long history and many variants. The earliest record of the folklore was included in the Panchatantra, which dates the story between 200 BCE and 300 CE.
Mary Frere included a version in her 1868 collection of Indian folktales, Old Deccan Days, the first collection of Indian folktales in English.  A version was also included in Joseph Jacobs' collection Indian Fairy Tales.

","A holy man passes a tiger in a trap. The tiger pleads for his release, promising not to eat the Brahmin. The Brahmin sets him free but no sooner is the tiger out of the cage then he says he is going to eat the Brahmin, going back on his promise.  The Brahmin is horrified and tells the tiger how unjust he is. They agree to ask the first three things they encounter to judge between them.  The first thing they encounter is a tree, who, having suffered at the hands of humans, answers that the tiger should eat the Brahmin. Next a buffalo, exploited and mistreated by humans, agrees it is only just that the Brahmin should be eaten.  Finally they meet a jackal who, sympathetic to the Brahmin's plight, at first feigns incomprehension of what has happened and asks to see the trap. Once there he claims he still doesn't understand. The tiger gets back in the trap to demonstrate and the jackal quickly shuts him in, suggesting to the Brahmin that they leave matters thus."
the_tinderbox,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tinderbox,The Tinderbox,"""The Tinderbox"" (Danish: Fyrtøjet) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a soldier who acquires a magic tinderbox capable of summoning three powerful dogs to do his bidding. When the soldier has one of the dogs transport a sleeping princess to his room, he is sentenced to death but cunningly summons the dogs to save his life.
In the Aarne-Thompson tale index, The Tinderbox is type 562: The Spirit in the Blue Light. Other tales of this type include The Three Dogs and The Blue Light.The tale has its source in a Scandinavian folk tale Andersen learned in his childhood, but similarities with ""Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp"" and other tales have been noted. The story was one of Andersen's first fairy tales, and was published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 8 May 1835 in an inexpensive booklet with three other tales by Andersen. The four tales were not favorably received by Danish critics who disliked their informal, chatty style and lack of morals. In 1946, ""The Tinderbox"" was the source material for Denmark's first animated film, and, in 2007, a ballet with costumes and scenery designed by Queen Margrethe II.","The story opens with a poor soldier returning home from war. He meets a witch, who asks him to climb into a hollow tree to retrieve a magic tinderbox. The witch gives the man permission to take anything he finds inside the chambers, but he must return the tinderbox. In the tree, he finds three chambers filled with precious coins guarded by three monstrous dogs, ""one with eyes the size of teacups"", who guards a vault filled with pennies, one with ""eyes the size of water wheels"", who guards a vault filled with silver, and one with eyes ""the size of Round Tower"", who guards a vault filled with gold. He fills his pockets with money, finds the tinderbox, and returns to the witch. When she demands the tinderbox without giving a reason, the soldier lops off her head with his sword.
In the following scene, the soldier enters a large city and buys himself splendid clothing and lives in a magnificent apartment. He makes many friends.  He learns of a princess kept in a tower after a prophecy foretold her marriage to a common soldier; his interest is piqued and he wants to see her but realizes his whim cannot be satisfied. Eventually, the soldier's money is depleted and he is forced to live in a dark attic. He strikes the tinderbox to light the room, and one of the dogs appears before him. The soldier then discovers he can summon all three dogs and order them to bring him money from their subterranean dwelling. Again, he lives splendidly.
One night, he recalls the story of the princess in the locked tower, and desires to see her. He strikes the tinderbox and sends the dog with eyes the size of teacups to bring her to his apartment. The soldier is overwhelmed with her beauty, kisses her and orders the dog to return her to the tower. The following morning, the princess tells her parents she has had a strange dream and relates the night's adventure. The royal couple then watch her closely. When the princess is carried away again, they unsuccessfully use a trail of flour and chalk marks on neighborhood doors to find where she spends her nights. Eventually, her whereabouts are discovered and the soldier is clapped in prison and sentenced to death. The tinderbox got left behind, so he cannot summon its help.
On the day of execution, the soldier sends a boy for his tinderbox, and, at the scaffold, asks to have a last smoke. He then strikes the tinderbox and the three monstrous dogs appear. They toss the judge and the councillors, the King and Queen into the air. All are dashed to pieces when they fall to earth. The soldier and the princess are united, and the dogs join the wedding feast."

","A beautiful young girl was made to work hard by her wicked stepmother. One day, the stepmother set her to pick twelve pounds of feathers before night and promised a beating if she failed. The girl cried. An old woman asked about her troubles; she told them, and the old woman promised all would be well and told her to lie down. The girl slept, and the old woman picked the feathers.
The next day, the stepmother set her to empty a pond with a spoon. The old woman had her sleep in a thicket and touched the pool with the spoon, which turned the pool to vapor.
The third day, the stepmother ordered her to build a castle in a rocky valley. The old woman had her sleep in the shade and moved the rocks to form a castle. The stepmother inspected every inch of it, promising a beating if it were not all as it should be; she went to check that the cellar was filled, and the cellar door fell on her, killing her.
The girl lived in the castle alone. It was filled with riches, and stories of her beauty and wealth spread. Many wooers came to her. At last, a king's son won her heart.  He went to get his father's consent. She kissed him, told him not to let anyone else kiss him on that cheek, and sat under a lime tree to await him. On the fourth day without his return, she packed up three dresses, embroidered with suns, moons, and stars, and set out to seek him. She was unable to find him, whoever she asked, and finally took a job as a cowherd and buried her jewels and dresses under a rock. She made a pet of a little calf and sang to it of her being abandoned.
After a few years, she heard that the king's daughter was to marry, and saw that the bridegroom was her prince. She sang to her calf as the prince rode by, and he looked at her, but he did not remember her. When three days' festivities were held to celebrate the marriage, she dressed herself in her gown with suns and went to the first ball. She so enchanted the prince that he forgot his new bride. The second night, she wore the gown with moons and enchanted him again; she had to promise to come the third night to get away. The third night, she wore the gown with stars, and when she kissed him, he remembered her. They went back to her castle and married there."

the_turtle_prince__folktale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtle_Prince_(folktale),The Turtle Prince (folktale),"The Turtle Prince or The Tortoise Prince (āmai rāja katai) refers to a group of South Indian and Sri Lankan folktales wherein a prince in turtle form marries a human princess.

","two stories of the turtle (tortoise) prince. In the first one, titled Faith is always rewarded, King Venkataja, from the city of Mallikârjunapurî, is married to a first wife who hasn't born him a son. So he divorces her, places the former queen in a separate pavilion next to the palace, and marries a second time. The new queen also does not bear him children. The King searches for illumination, and Mahêsvara and the Sûlapânin Isa help him by giving him a magical mango-fruit that shall help the new queen. The servants press the mango and prepare a juice for her to drink. As for the mango seed, the first queen's servant takes it and gives her. The queen breaks a portion of the seed and gives to her maid. The second queen gives birth to twin boys, the maid to a son and the first queen to a tortoise. The narrative says that the tortoise son was no ordinary turtle, but a beautiful prince born of Paramêsvara's favour. The first queen feeds the tortoise. One night, the tortoise moves toward his mother's plate of rice, takes off its shell and becomes a boy. He eats the rice and hides again under the tortoise shell. The mother notices the missing food and suspects the maidservant, but decides to investigate further: that night, she pretends to be asleep, and sees the tortoise moving towards the bowl of rice, taking off its shell and becoming a human boy. The queen smashes the shell. When the boy tries to find it, he sees the shell has been destroyed. He wakes his mother and explains that he needed the shell for some more time before he revealed himself truly. He then says he will paint himself with soot and charcoal and asks his mother to hide him in a box. God Parmêsvara instructs sages and learned men to go to the city to teach the prince in the box.

Some time later, the king instructs his twin sons to go up north, to the furthest mountain, Himayagiri (""the frosty mountain""), and get a princess as their father's third wife. Meanwhile, their half-brother, the tortoise prince, using his gift of Jñanâdrishti (a sort of cosmic awareness or omniscience), learns of the quest and knows their endeavor will fail if he does not go with them. He puts some more charcoal on his skin and accompanies the twin princes. They reach a red-coloured stream and think of drinking the water, but the prince knows that the stream was the refuse water from the princess's bath. So he takes his two half-brothers, one on each arm, and leaps from one margin to the other. The princess sees the event, for she has declared she will marry the man who can cross the stream. The princess tells her father of the incident and to prepare her marriage to the extraordinary man. The man agrees, with the condition that he still wears the black soot on the ceremony. They marry, and the man reveals to his wife his royal origins, and advises her that she should come to Himayagiri should he not returns in 28 days' time.

The tortoise prince (in his disguise) and the twin princes continue their journey. In another city, a similar marriage test is imposed on the princess's potential suitor: a peon on the city entrance gives a pie for travellers and says they must find firewood, leaf and oil, and return the pie. The prince-as-black deduces the answer and gives the man a sesamum plant (stem for firewood, its leaves as leaves, and its seed for oil). The princess marries the black prince; the prince reveals his origins and tells her to go after him if he does not return after an appointed time.

In a third city, a Pândita (learned lady) set a task: she will present her suitor a book of her writings on philosophy to her suitor and he must write a satisfactory comment on it. The black prince does and marries the third princess. They marry and he relates his story to her and the purpose of the journey. The princess tells him how to find the princess of Himayagiri: one should circulate and mountain, find the creeper, climb onto it and be taken to her presence, and prostrate before her and call her his mother.

The black prince goes to Himayagiri and sees that his two brothers have stopped at its base. The prince does as his third wife advised, meets the princess and explains the purpose of the visit. She decides to join him and his brothers and climb down the creeper. The princess says she forgot a golden scimitar up the mountain and the prince goes back. On that moment, his two brothers, jealous of his successes through their journey, cut the rope and he falls to his death.

The twin princes bring the maiden from Himayagiri to their father, but she tells her to postpone the wedding for six months, since she will make a penance. Meanwhile, the tortoise's three wives go to the place he dies and weep over his shattered body. The third wive, the learned woman, tells the other two to gather his remains for she knows of a way to revive him. The three wives pray and resurrect him. The quartet visits each kingdom, gets presents and dowries, and return in secret to his father's kingdom to meet the tortoise prince's mother.

After six months, the maiden from Himayagiri asks for a last item before her wedding: a golden lotus flower from the beyond the seven oceans, that only the tortoise prince can get - if he is still alive, that is. She mockingly tells her prospective husband-to-be that if his twin sons brought her back, surely they can fetch the flower.

The twin princes go to the ocean shore and remember their treachery towards their extraordinary companion. The black prince appears behind them and offers to get the flower, for he was instructed to do so by his third wife. He takes seven pebbles and uses each of them to drain the seven oceans; He then reaches a sacred water called Akhilâdudakoti brahmânda, chants a summon command, gives a Rakshasa a note from his third wife, jumps on a crocodile and gets the golden lotus.

The tortoise prince and the twin half-brothers deliver the flower to the maiden from Himayagiri. She finally consents to the wedding and asks the king to send invitations to all lords of the world, and to have the first wife, his son and his three wives give her in marriage. The king visits his first wife and notices the three princesses, but decides to keep up appearances and feigh knowledge of them. On the wedding day, where the kings of all parts of the world are assembled, the maiden from Himayagiri tells them the story of the tortoise prince, his mother, his father and his journey. The guests want to hear the story from the mouth of the tortoise prince. The king embraces the tortoise prince as his son and marries the maiden from Himayagiri. The prince forgives his half-brothers' misgivings and they live peacefully.

second tale, titled True merit shall be rewarded, in the northern city of Amarâvati, king Alakiyasingarâja and his minister Subhamantrî are good friends, and promise each other to marry their children to each other, if they have them. Months later, the queen gives birth to a tortoise and the minister's wife to a daughter. Years pass and the king laments his lot of having a tortoise son. The tortoise prince talks to him and suggests they go through with the marriage promise. The minister cannot consent to the marriage because of the suitor's status as an animal, but his eldest daughter tells him that she made a vow to marry whomever brought her the parijata flower.

The tortoise prince wants his father to throw him in the ocean so he may begin his quest. The king does and the animal son swims the seven mighty oceans to reach Udayagiri, the mountain where the Sun rises every morning. He salutes the Sun-god, Sûrya-bhagavan, and his charioteer, Aruna, as they begin the daily journey. The Sun questions the tortoise as to the purpose of his presence. The tortoise prince says he was born as animal in this life, but chants 1,008 praises to the deity. The Sun-god tells him that his tortoise shape was a penance for a misdeed in a previous life and blesses him with the ability to assume a human state at will. As a last aid, the Sun-god directs the now human prince towards a nearby sage.

The prince meets the sage, who directs him to two other sages. The third sage tells him that in the temple, there is a garden with a lake, where the divine maidens (Apsaras) come to bathe. He should hide nearby and steal the clothes of one of them, escape to Ganêsa's temple, bolt the door and hold onto to it for enough time to convince the maiden to get the parijata flowers for him. It happens as described and the Apsara regains her dress and rejoins her sisters. In her divine realm, she commissions a Vînâ guitar from the divine carpenter, takes a basketful of parijata flowers and dishes and returns to the prince.

The divine maiden sets the dishes before them for a meal and explains that the guitar can summon her and the wonderful dishes he sees before him. The prince descends the temple the next day and enters the third sage's house. The third sage notices the magic guitar and wishes to trade it for a self-attacking club that can decimate armies. The prince parts with the guitar for the club. When he leaves, the club talks to him that its previous owner, the third sage, has not given him food for the last generation and wants to beat him. The prince agrees and the club kills the third sage. The same event happens to the other two sages: the second sage trades a magic purse for the guitar and the first a pair of teleporting sandals; the prince kills them with the club and retrieves the magic guitar.

He summons the divine maiden and has dinner with her one last for (for now). He explains that he will deliver the parijata flower to the minister's daughter and marry her, but he will give her the other magical objects for her to hide. He assumes the tortoise shape and swims back to his father's kingdom to present the minister's daughter with the flowers.

She receives the flowers and consents to a wedding date. The minister 's eldest daughter marries the tortoise prince, to her sadness, and her sisters normal husbands. One night, while his human wife is asleep, the prince crawls to the shore, to the place where the divine maiden hid the objects (a baniyan tree), and commands the club to take off his tortoise shell. He summons the maiden with the guitar and they have a splendid meal.

One day, his brothers-in-law decide to go hunting. The tortoise prince tells his wife to prepare a sword and a mount, for he will join them. So she does, despite expecting the mockery of the people. The tortoise prince rides his lame horse to the baniyan tree, takes off the tortoise shell and becomes a man. He wears the sandals and the club and spreads divine ashes over his body. HIs brothers-in-law see him and mistake him for a god himself, and dines with him. The prince pretends to bless the pair and asks for their little finger in return. Both men agree and cut off their fingers to give him. On a second hunt, the god-like prince demands their rings.

Some time later, an enemy army marches to conquer their city, and the tortoise prince is the only one that can help his brothers-in-law. He orders his wife to prepare a seven tubs of hot water when he returns. He rides as a tortoise, retreats someplace and returns as a human with the magic club to vanquish the enemy army, to their brothers-in-law' admiration. He dons the tortoise shell and returns to his wife.

He bids his wife leave the room, takes off the tortoise shell and enters the bath. His wife, spying on the other side of the door, sees his human form and swoons. She wakes up and breaks the tortoise shell. After the prince exits the bath, he demands his tortoise shell back, but his wife explains she smashed it to pieces. The prince excuses her and drops onto the bed out of sheer exhaustion. The minister's daughter rushes to her parents to show them the true form of her husband. The king and queen also see their son's human form. The brothers-in-law recognize him as the god-like bring they met in the forest. The prince and the minister's daughter remarry and he assumes the throne."

The Queen tells this to their youngest son, Benjamin, and that she will give them a warning with a flag. A white flag indicates that a baby boy was born, and a blood red flag indicates a girl was born and that the boys should run far away

In the meantime the Queen gives birth to a beautiful girl with a star on her forehead.
Ten years later, after hearing of their existence from her mother, the sister leaves to find them where the queen hid them for precaution.

It is of Aarne-Thompson type 306.Charles Deulin collected another, French version in his Contes du Roi Cambrinus (1874), which he credited to the Grimm version.  Alexander Afanasyev collected two Russian variants, entitled ""The Night Dances"", in his Narodnye russkie skazki.Its closest analogue is the Scottish Kate Crackernuts, where it is a prince who is obliged to dance every night.","Twelve princesses sleep in twelve beds in the same room. Every night, their doors are securely locked by their father. But in the morning, their dancing shoes are found to be worn through as if they had been dancing all night. The king, perplexed, asks his daughters to explain, but they refuse. The king then promises his kingdom and each daughter to any man who can discover the princesses' midnight secret within three days and three nights, but those who fail within the set time limit will be sentenced to death.
An old soldier returned from war comes to the king's call after several princes have failed in the attempt. Whilst traveling through a wood he comes upon an old woman, who gives him an enchanted cloak that he can use to observe the king's unaware daughters and tells him not to eat or drink anything given to him in the evening by any of the princesses and to pretend to be fast asleep until they leave.
The soldier is well received at the palace just as the others had been and indeed, in the evening, the princess royal (the eldest daughter) comes to his chamber and offers him a cup of wine. The soldier, remembering the old woman's advice, secretly throws it away and begins to snore loudly as if asleep.
The twelve princesses, assured that the soldier is asleep, dress themselves in fine dancing gowns and escape from their room by a trap door in the floor. The soldier, seeing this, puts on his magic cloak and follows them. He steps on the gown of the youngest princess, whose cry of alarm to her sisters is rebuffed by the eldest. The passageway leads them to three groves of trees; the first having leaves of silver, the second of gold, and the third of glittering diamonds. The soldier, wishing for a token, breaks off a twig of each as evidence. They walk on until they come upon a great clear lake. Twelve boats, with twelve princes, appear where the twelve princesses are waiting. Each princess gets into one, and the soldier steps into the same boat with the twelfth and youngest princess. The youngest princess complains that the prince is not rowing fast enough, not knowing the soldier is in the boat. On the other side of the lake stands a castle, into which all the princesses go and dance the night away.
The twelve princesses happily dance all night until their shoes are worn through and they are obliged to leave. The strange adventure continues on the second and third nights, and everything happens just as before, except that on the third night the soldier carries away a golden cup as a token of where he has been. When it comes time for him to declare the princesses' secret, he goes before the king with the three branches and the golden cup, and tells the king about all he has seen. The princesses know that there is no use in denying the truth, and confess. The soldier chooses the eldest princess as his bride for he is not a very young man, and is made the King's heir. The twelve princes are put under a curse for as many nights as they danced with the princesses."

One day, the prince was summoned to his father's deathbed and was so grief-stricken that he promised he would marry the neighboring princess whom his father wished he would marry. After his father died and the prince became king, he felt bound by his promise to marry the other princess. His fiancee heard of the new king's promise and asked her father for eleven maidens who looked exactly like her. Each maiden dressed as huntsmen went to the king's court.
At court, the king had a lion who knew everything. It told him that the huntsmen were women, and to test them, the king should put peas on the floor:  a man's firm step would crush them, while a woman's would make them roll. The maiden heard this and warned her companions to step firmly. And so, when the huntsmen stepped on the peas, they were crushed. The lion then said the king should put spinning wheels in the room, betraying the maidens' interest. Once again, the maiden learned of the lion's plan and warned her companions. The lion soon fell from favor as the king believed he did not know everything, as once thought.
When the king's new bride entered court, the maiden fainted. Fearing that a faithful servant had fallen ill, the king came to her aid and found she had the ring he had given her. He dismissed the new bride and married the maiden, and restored the lion to favor as it had seen the truth."
the_twelve_months__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Months_(fairy_tale),The Twelve Months (fairy tale),"""The Twelve Months"" is a Slovak fairy tale, which was first mentioned by a Czech writer, scholar, physician, lexicographer, canon of the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague and a master of the University of Prague in the 14th century - mistr Klaret/Bartoloměj z Chlumce, who mentions the fairy tale as a preaching exemplum.
It was later collected by one of the most famous Czech writers - Božena Němcová.
The fairy tale was later adapted as a theater play by a Russian writer, Samuil Marshak in 1943, and subsequently in the Soviet cinematography. There's also a Czech film adaptation from 2012.
The Russian adaptations of the Slovak folk fairy tale are often mistaken for the original, they often vary from the original, mainly by adding new characters (like the young girl of the Russian nobility, a Russian soldier, etc.)
Some adaptations originated from other adaptations, e.g. the Japanese Twelve Months (1980 film).

","A young and beautiful girl (called Marushka in some variations) is sent into the cold forest in the winter to perform impossible tasks by her evil stepmother. She must get spring violets, summer strawberries and fall apples in midwinter as presents to give her stepsister for her birthday. The girl ventures out into the blizzard and eventually meets the 12 personified months by a warm fire in the woods. When she approaches and asks politely if she might warm her hands at their fire, they ask why she is there, and when she tells them about her step-family and what she is looking for, the spirits help her. The child spirit of March creates the violets, youthful June the strawberries, and grown September the apples, at the direction of the elderly January. The stepmother and sister take the items, without a word of thanks. When the evil stepsister comes to search for the twelve months herself in the snow, hoping for gifts of her own, the spirits disappear, taking their fire, and leaving the stepsister cold and hungry, searching for eternity. The same fate lay in store for the wicked stepmother. She too let greed run away with her and to this day she still searches in an unfriendly forest for the path back to her home. The kind sister remained in her house, and lived happily ever after."

It is one of the stories of the previous lives of Buddha in which Rathasena, the son of one of the twelve women, is the bodhisattva.","A rich man, who is ruined after having twelve daughters, abandons them in a forest. They are adopted by an ogress, Sandhamāra, but escape to Kutāra. After they are found in a banyan tree, emitting a golden aura, the king of Kutāra makes all of them his queens. Sandhamāra enraptures the king, is made his major queen, and persuades him to pluck out the twelve queens’ eyes, leaving only the youngest with sight in one eye. The eleven others become pregnant. Sakka sends down the Bodhisatta Rathasena to be conceived by the youngest. The king has all twelve imprisoned in a cave. When the eleven give birth, they share their babies’ flesh as food. The youngest gives birth to Rathasena. On growing up, Rathasena appeals to Sakka to provide them with cloth and ornaments, and to teach him to gamble.
To feed the twelve, he gambles, first with cowherds, later with the king. When the king learns that this remarkable boy is his own son, Sandhamāra maneuvers to have him sent to the ogre realm carrying a letter. On the way he meets a rishi who reads the letter, finds that Rathasena is being sent to the ogre realm to be eaten, and changes the wording. On Rathasena's arrival, the ogress's daughter falls in love with him, and he is anointed with her to rule the realm. After a dalliance, he takes her to the royal park, gets her drunk, learns from her the means to restore the sight to the twelve sisters, and escapes. On failing to follow him, the ogress's daughter dies of a broken heart. On seeing him return, the ogress Sandhamāra dies of defeat. Rathasena restores sight to the twelve, who again become queens."
the_two_brothers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Brothers,The Two Brothers,"The Two Brothers is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 60.  It is Aarne-Thompson type 303, ""The Blood Brothers"", with an initial episode of type 567, ""The Magic Bird Heart"". A similar story, of Sicilian origin, was also collected by author and folklorist Andrew Lang in The Pink Fairy Book.","A rich goldsmith and a poor broommaker were brothers. The broommaker had two identical twin sons.  One day, the broommaker saw a golden bird in the woods, knocked off a feather, and sold it to his brother for a great sum.  He pursued the bird again and found a golden lamp.  A third time, he brought back the bird itself, and his brother, who knew its powers—that whoever ate its heart and liver would find a gold coin beneath his pillow every night—had his wife cook it.  But his nephews came to the kitchen to beg, and when two bits fell from the bird, they ate them, and the gold coins appeared beneath their pillows.
The goldsmith told his brother that his sons were working with the devil, and persuaded him to abandon them.  A huntsman took them in and taught them his trade.  Once they were grown, they begged his permission to seek their fortune.  He was pleased, because they talked like brave huntsmen, and he let them go. He then gave them a knife with directions that if they ever parted, they should stick the knife into a tree, and when either one returned, he could see how his brother was faring because the blade's side would rust if things were going badly for him.
On the way, they nearly shot a hare for hunger, but it begged for its life, offering to give them two young hares instead, so they let it go. The same happened with a fox, a wolf, a bear, and a lion. The young animals showed them a village where they could buy food. They parted ways, each one taking half the animals, and drove a knife into a tree where they parted.
The younger came to a town all hung in black, where a dragon had eaten every young maiden except the princess, who was to be given to it the next day. The huntsman climbed the dragon's hill and found three cups and a sword. He was unable to wield the sword until he had drunk from the cups.

The next morning, the princess was brought to the hill, and the king's marshal watched.  The seven-headed dragon came and breathed fire, setting all the grass ablaze, but the animals trampled the flames out. The huntsman cut off six of its heads and its tail and had the animals tear it to bits.  The princess distributed her necklace among the animals, and gave the huntsman her knife, with which he cut off the dragon's tongues. He was exhausted and told the lion to keep watch while he slept, but the lion was also exhausted, and told the bear to keep watch, and so on down to the hare, who had no one to tell to keep watch. The marshal cut off the huntsman's head and forced the princess to promise to say that he had rescued her.
The animals woke and would have killed the hare, but it said it knew of a root that would restore the huntsman, so they let it fetch it. The huntsman thought the princess must have killed him, to be rid of him, and wandered the world.  A year later, he came back to the town and found it hung in red for the princess's wedding to the marshal. The huntsman bet with the innkeeper that he could get bread from the king's table, and sent the hare.  The princess recognized it by the part of her necklace, and sent a loaf with it. The innkeeper would bet no more, but he sent the fox, wolf, bear, and lion for meat, vegetables, confectionery, and wine.
The king wondered at the animals, and the princess told him to send for their master. When he arrived at the castle, the seven dragon's heads were displayed, and the huntsman opened their mouth and asked where their tongues were. He produced the tongues, and the princess confirmed his story. The marshal was executed, and the huntsman and princess married.
One day, the young king hunted a white stag and ended up alone in the woods. An old woman begged to come near the fire, and asked him to strike his animals with a wand so they would not harm her. This turned them to stone, and so she was able to turn him to stone. The older twin found the knife all rusted on one side, and went in search of his brother. He was welcomed as the young king in the town, but put a sword in the bed between himself and the princess. Hearing what his younger brother had been doing, he set out to the same woods and found the same witch, but refused to strike his animals. When he shot his gun at her, she was invulnerable to lead, but he tore off three silver buttons and shot her again. He made her restore his brother, his brother's animals, and many others.
The brothers went home, telling their tales. On hearing that his older brother had been accepted as him and slept in his bed, the young king cut off his head, but repented of it.  The hare brought the root again, and the brother was restored. They returned to the town, and the princess could recognize her husband by the necklace on his animals, and asked him why he had put the sword in the bed that night, revealing to him that his brother had been true."

","A woman had a daughter and stepdaughter.  One day she set them to spin while sitting on the edge of a well, giving her daughter good flax and her stepdaughter coarse, unusable flax, and declared that whoever's thread broke first would be thrown in.  When her stepdaughter's thread broke, she threw her in.
The girl fell to a wonderful land.  She walked on and came to a tumble-down fence, overgrown with vines.  It pleaded with her not to hurt it, because it did not have long to live, and she carefully jumped over it where the vines were less.  She found an oven full of loaves, and it told her she could eat what she liked, but begged her not to hurt it.  She ate a loaf, thanked it for such fine bread, and shut its door.  She came to a cow with a bucket on its horns; it said she could milk it and drink, but asked her not to hurt it or spill its milk.  She agreed, and when a drop of milk was left, the cow told her to throw it over its hooves and hang the bucket back up.
She came to a house.  An old woman asked her to comb her hair.  When she did, the old woman showed her a farm where she could take service.  She took good care of the cows, gave milk to the cats, and when she sieved corn, gave some to the birds.
One day, her mistress summoned her and told her to fill a sieve full of water and bring it back.  The birds told her to use ashes to stop up the holes.  Another day, she had to wash some black yarn until it became white, and white yarn until it became black.  The birds told her to face east to turn the black white, and west to turn the white black.  Then her mistress had her weave them into a robe as smooth as a king's by sunset, but the skeins tangled and broke every moment.  The cats wove it on her behalf.
She wanted to leave and go home.  Her mistress sent her to an attic and told her to take whatever casket she liked.  She considered many beautiful ones, but the cats directed her to a black one, so she took it and went home.  Her stepmother took her wages, but the box was filled with marvelous treasures.
Her stepmother put her own daughter on the edge of the well, to spin with coarse stuff, and threw her down the well when it broke.  The daughter proceeded as her sister had, but was rude to everyone on the wall, and worked very poorly at the farm, including the three tasks her stepsister had done.  At the end of the year, she went on her way with a large red casket.  When she opened it at home, fire burst out and burned her and her mother to death."

It was first published on 11 November 1843 in New Fairy Tales. First Volume. First Collection, with three other tales by Andersen in Copenhagen, Denmark to great critical acclaim. The tale has been adapted to various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is an original story by Andersen.","After a mother duck's eggs hatch, one of the ducklings is perceived by the other animals as an ugly little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse. He wanders from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly, and once again he sets off alone.
The duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited but cannot join them, for he is too young, ugly, and unable to fly. When winter arrives, a farmer finds and carries the freezing duckling home, but he is frightened by the farmer's noisy children and flees the house. The duckling spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over.
The duckling, now having fully grown and matured, cannot endure a life of solitude and hardship any more. He decides to throw himself at a flock of swans, feeling that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been not a duckling but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and he spreads his wings to take flight with the rest of his new family."
the_brave_little_tailor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valiant_Little_Tailor,The Brave Little Tailor,"""The Brave Little Tailor"" or ""The Valiant Little Tailor"" or ""The Gallant Tailor"" (German: Das tapfere Schneiderlein) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 20). ""The Brave Little Tailor"" is a story of Aarne–Thompson Type 1640, with individual episodes classified in other story types.Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book. The tale was translated as Seven at One Blow. Another of many versions of the tale appears in A Book of Giants by Ruth Manning-Sanders.
It is about a humble tailor who tricks many giants and a ruthless king into believing in the tailor's incredible feats of strength and bravery, leading to him winning wealth and power.

","A tailor is preparing to eat some jam, but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading ""Seven at One Blow"". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that ""Seven at One Blow"" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a ""rock"" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.
Impressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.
The tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabs the giants in their hearts.

The king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.
Duly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the king's servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says ""Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!"" Terrified, the king's servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right."

Wolfram Eberhard pointed out that ""elements"" of the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index type ATU 565 appear here. Other tales of this type are Sweet Porridge and Why the Sea Is Salt -- Why the Sea Is Salt also using it as an explanatory legend.

","A woman lived with her mother-in-law and daughter; though she was dutiful, her mother-in-law hated her.  One day, she decreed that they could not buy water from water-carriers, but her daughter-in-law would have to carry it from the well.  The work was too hard for her, but she was beaten when she failed.  One day, she thought of drowning herself in the well.  An old woman told her not to, and gave her a stick, which, when used to strike the pail, would fill it with water. She was to tell no one of the stick's power, and to never strike the pail twice.
For a time, she was happy, but her mother-in-law spied on her, stole the stick, and struck the pail twice.  This caused a flood that drowned many houses and her daughter-in-law.  The pail had become a spring.  Afterward, a temple was raised for the daughter-in-law, and they called her the Water Mother."

The nixie chased them.  The girl threw a brush, which became a mountain with thousands of spikes, which the nixie got through with great effort.  The boy threw a comb behind them, which became mountains with thousands of teeth, which the nixie got through with great effort.

","A king was dying. An old man told his sons that the water of life would save him. Each one set out in turn. The two older ones, setting out in hopes of being the heir, were rude to a dwarf on the way and became trapped in ravines. When the youngest son went the dwarf asked where he was going, and he told him. The dwarf told him it was in a castle, and gave him an iron wand to open the gates and two loaves to feed to the lions inside.  Then he had to get the water before the clock struck 12 when the gates would shut again.
He opened the gate with the wand and fed the lions the bread. Then he came to a hall where there were sleeping princes, and he took rings from their fingers and some bread and a sword from the table. He went on and found a beautiful princess, who kissed him, told him he had freed her, and promised to marry him if he returned within a year. Then she told him where the spring was. He went on, but saw a bed and lay down to sleep. When he woke, it was a quarter to twelve. He sprang up, got the water, and escaped, with the closing gate taking off the heel of his boot.
He met the dwarf who told him what happened to his brothers and at his imploring freed them, warning that they had evil hearts. They came to a kingdom plagued by war and famine, the prince killed their foes with the sword and fed them with the loaf. Then they came to two more kingdoms in the same situation, and they did the same. Then they got on a ship to cross the sea and come home. The older brothers stole the water of life and filled his bottle with sea water.
The king was sickened by the sea water. The older brothers accused the youngest of trying to poison him and gave him the water of life. The king decided to have his youngest son secretly killed (as punishment). He sent a huntsman with him into the woods, but the huntsman was unable to bring himself to kill him and confessed the deed to the prince. The prince and the huntsman swapped clothes and the prince fled.
Treasure arrived, from the three kingdoms the youngest prince had saved, and the king wondered about his guilt and regretted having his son killed. The huntsman confessed that he had not killed him, and so the king issued a proclamation that he could freely return.
The princess in the castle had made a golden road to it and told her people that it would bring her true groom to her and to admit no one who did not ride straight up it. The two older princes (who were pretending to be the ones who freed her) saw it and thought it would be a shame to get it dirty, so they rode alongside, and the servants did not admit them. The youngest thought so constantly of the princess that he did not notice it, so he rode up it, was admitted, and they married. The prince went back to his father and told the true story. The king wished to punish the older brothers, but they had already boarded a ship and were never seen again."

","Three brothers and a sister worked very hard, became rich, and built a palace.  It was much admired, but an old woman told them it needed a church.  They built a church.  It was even more admired, but an old man told them it needed a pitcher of the water of life, a branch where the smell of the flowers gave eternal beauty, and the talking bird.  The oldest brother decided to set out after it.  They asked the old man how they could know he was safe, and the man gave them a knife:  as long as it was bright, he was well, but when it was bloody, evil had happened to him.
He met with a giant who told him he had to walk past stones that would mock him; if he did not turn, he could gain what he was after, but if he did, he would turn to stone as well.  He went to the mountain, but the stones jeered at him, so loudly he turned to throw a rock at them, and turned to stone.
Warned by the knife that something had happened, his two brothers followed him, and suffered the same fate.
Their sister followed, but did not turn. At the top, she found a pool, and the bird perched on a branch of the tree.  She took them all, but was tired, and let spill a few drops, which turned the people back to life. She sprinkled the water on all the stones and restored them all to life.  At home, she planted the tree and watered it, and it grew, and the bird perched in its boughs.
A prince came to see the wonders, and married the sister in the church they had built."

Scholars related it to the cycle of the animal bridegroom: a human woman that marries a supernatural husband in animal form and, after losing him, has to seek him out.

","The following summary is based on Rachel Harriette Busk's and Bernhard Jülg's translations of the story.In a distant kingdom called Fair-flower-garden, a man lives with his three daughters grazing their goat herds. One day, the goats vanish, and the elder daughter goes to look for them. She finds a large red door and goes through, then a gate of mother-of-pearl and another of emerald. A white bird appears to her and tells her that he can show where her herds are, as long as she consents to marry him. The elder daughter refuses.
The next day, the middle daughter goes to look for the goats, and the same bird appears with the same proposal. She also refuses. The following day, the youngest daughter goes to look for her goats, and bird appears to her. The youngest believes its words and agrees to marry him.
Some time after, a large gathering is happening near a local temple, and will last 13 days. The white bird's wife joins the people as the loveliest woman in the gathering. A mysterious rider on a dappled gray horse also joins the people. The white bird's wife goes back to the bird's palace and tells her husband about the rider at the gathering.
This goes on for the next days. On the 12th day of the gathering, the white bird's wife pours out her heart to an old woman about the mysterious rider. The old woman advises the girl to pretend to go to the gathering, wait for her husband to take off the birdskin, assume human form and ride to the festival on his dappled gray horse.
On the 13th day, the girl waits until her husband becomes human and leaveson his horse, then burns the perch, the birdcage and the featherskin. Later, after her husband returns, the girl tells him that she burned his featherskin and the cage, to keep him in human form permanently. Her husband despair at her action, because his soul was inside the cage, and now ""gods and dæmons"" will come for him. The only solution is for her to stand the gate of mother-of-pearl and hew a stick for seven days and seven nights, without interruption.
The girl gets some motes of feather-grass to apply to her eyelids. She resists for seven days, but, on the seventh night, the motes of grass come off her eyes and she fails the task, thus allowing her husband to be taken. She then goes looking for him anywhete between the heavens and the earth.
One day, she hears his voice coming from up in the mountains. She follows it until she reaches a stream, where she finds her husband, carrying pairs of boots on his back. He explains that the gods and demons made him their water-carrier, and the worn-out boots indicate that he has been like this for some time. The girl asks what she can do to rescue him, and her husband tells her to build a new birdcage and to woo his soul back into it."

First he says that the one who can obtain the smallest and most beautiful dog will be the next king, and gives them a year to obtain it.
The three princes set off separately. The youngest son travels for some time, seeking smaller dogs, until he discovers a fantastically decorated castle hidden in the woods. He soon discovers that it is inhabited entirely by intelligent, talking cats. Their queen is a beautiful little white cat, who invites the prince to dinner and entertains him. He is surprised to see that the cat wears a locket containing a portrait that looks just like him. The prince remains in the white cat's castle happily for nearly a year, enjoying many entertainments, until the white cat reminds him of his mission and bestows him with an acorn, telling him that the dog is inside. When he returns home and breaks open the acorn, inside is an impossibly tiny dog which dances before the king.
Although the youngest prince is clearly the winner of the contest, the king sends the princes out once more, this time in search of muslin fine enough to be drawn through the eye of a needle. While his brothers begin to search once more, the youngest prince returns immediately to the white cat's castle and spends another year there. At the end of the year, she sends him home with a fine escort and golden chariot, as well as a walnut. The older two princes bring muslin which can fit through the eye of a large needle. Inside the youngest prince's walnut is a hazelnut seed, which contains a successively smaller seeds. Inside the smallest seed is a massive amount of muslin, magnificently embroidered, which fits through the eye of any needle.
The king sets a third task, telling them that whoever can win the most beautiful princess for a bride would be king. The youngest prince returns once more to the white cat's castle, and she promises to help him win this contest as well. Over the next  year, he guesses at the cat's background, but she refuses to tell him.
At the end of the year, she tells him that she can give him a beautiful princess, but only if he will first cut off her head. The prince at first refuses to cut off his beloved cat's head, but is eventually forced to comply. Then, from the cat's body appears a beautiful woman, while the cat courtiers are transformed into humans.
The princess finally explains her past. Her mother was a queen who promised her, before she was born, in return for fairy fruit. The fairies then raised her in a tower that was impossible to enter except through a high window. While the fairies arranged a marriage for her to an ugly fairy king, she fell in love with a human king who passed by her tower, and planned to escape with him. However, the fairies caught him in her tower room. They killed him and transformed her and the people of her kingdom into cats. She would only be free when she found a man identical to her dead lover.
The prince and the former white cat set out for the prince's kingdom, where she is found to be far more beautiful than his older brothers' brides. However, the former white cat rules over six kingdoms, and bestows a kingdom each on his father and older brothers, leaving her and the youngest son still with three kingdoms over which to reign. They celebrate a triple wedding."

Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book.,"A crab (or lobster, in some translations) brought a childless queen to a fairy palace, where she was revealed as the fairy of the spring and took the form of a little old lady.  The fairies promised the queen that she would soon birth a daughter that should be named Desirée. The crab took offense for being the only one not to be invited to the princess's christening.  The crab would not be placated by the excuses of the fairies for the slight, warned them that the princess was in danger but did not explain the curse, should sunlight touch Desiree in the first fifteen years of her life.
On the advice of the other fairies, the king and queen built a subterranean castle for the princess to live in.  When her fifteenth birthday approached, the queen had her portrait made and sent it to all the neighboring princes.  One fell so in love with her that he often shut himself up with the portrait and talked to it.  When the king, his father, learned this, the prince persuaded him to break a betrothal with the Black Princess and send an ambassador to Desirée.  The fairy Tulip, who loved Desiree best, warned not to let the ambassador see her before the birthday.  At his suit, however, they agreed to bring the portrait to the princess, who was much taken by it, and to hold the wedding in three months, after her birthday.
The prince was so love-sick that the king sent messages to implore them to put forward the wedding.
Meanwhile, the Black Princess was deeply offended.  Though she declared that he had his freedom, because she could not love a dishonorable man, she implored the aid of her fairy godmother, the fairy of the spring, who was reminded of the injury and resolved to harm Desirée.

Hearing that the prince was dying for love of her, Desirée proposed that she travel by closed carriage, and open it for food only at night.  When this was put into effect, the mother of a jealous lady-in-waiting , persuaded by her daughter, cut open the coach and let light on the princess.  She instantly turned into a white doe and bounded off.  The fairy of the spring created a thunderstorm that frightened off the servants. A faithful lady-in-waiting chased the doe, and the jealous  disguised herself as the princess and went on.  She pleaded the thunderstorm for her condition, but her ugliness astounded the prince.  He left the palace rather than endure such a marriage, and went to the forest with only the ambassador.
The fairy Tulip led the faithful lady-in-waiting to the doe and after witnessing their reunion, appeared.  She could only turn the princess back to a woman by night and direct them to a hut where they might stay.  An old woman took them in there; somewhat later, the ambassador found it, and the old woman gave him and the prince shelter.  The next day, the prince saw the doe and shot at it, but the fairy Tulip protected her.  The day after, the doe avoided where he had shot, and the prince hunted long for her, until he, exhausted, slept.  The doe came upon him and, seeing she had the advantage of him, studied him.  She woke him, and he chased her until she was exhausted and let him catch her.  He treated her as a fond pet, but she escaped before nightfall, for fear that her change would shock him.  The next day, the prince wounded her and was much distressed, but took her back by force to the hut.  The lady-in-waiting objected and the prince had to give up the doe.  The ambassador told him that he had seen the lady-in-waiting at Desiree's court. They had made a hole in the partition between the rooms, and saw the princess and heard her laments.  They were joyously united.  At dawn, she did not retransform into a doe.
An army of his father's came, and the prince went out to explain what he had learned.  The prince married the princess, and the ambassador married the lady-in-waiting."

","Two princes were caught in a storm at sea when the sky had no sun. An old woman rowed up in a dough-trough and said she could save them in return for the next returning son their mother bore. They said they could not trade him, and the woman said that their mother might prefer the sons she had to the one she did not, and rowed off.

But a witch came to him one day in a storm and told him his brothers had promised him in return for their lives. He said if she had saved them, he would go with her. She sailed away with him over the sea to her residence. 
In her service, the witch set him to sort a great mass of feathers in one day. He had all but finished when a whirlwind mixed them together again, with only an hour left. A white dove tapped on the window and offered to help him. He let it in and it sorted the feathers.  
The next day, she set him to split wood, and the longer he worked, the larger the pile seemed to grow. The dove offered to split it for him, and did so; he could barely carry away the pieces fast enough. It perched on his shoulder, and he kissed it, and it turned into a beautiful princess. She told him that he must ask the witch for a wish, and then ask for the princess she keeps as a white dove, but first he must tie a red thread about her leg so that he would know her.  
When he asked, the witch dragged a donkey in front of him and asked if he wanted it; recognizing the red thread, he agreed. She tried again, with an old hag, and when the prince agreed, she had to have the wedding. At the wedding, the princess told the prince not to drink anything at the feast, or he would forget her. He forgot and reached for a glass, but the princess spilled it and the witch raged. They were put into bed, and the princess said that the witch had done all that she promised, and so they had to flee.  
She left two pieces of wood in the bed, and they answered the witch, so she did not realize they were gone until morning. Then she chased after them. The princess had the prince threw down a flower pot, which became a forest, which slowed the witch as she had to chop through it. Then the princess had the prince throw down a glass of water, which became a lake, and the witch had to go back for her dough trough to cross it. Then they climbed into the castle as she reached them, and the princess turned and blew on her. Hundreds of white doves flew out of her mouth. The witch was so angry that she turned to flint forever.
The older brothers confessed what they had done and said he must be king, and they would be his subjects. They were his subjects until they found their own princesses and then fled."

Meanwhile, the white duck built a nest, laid three eggs, and hatched two fluffy ducklings and one little drake. She warned them against the castle, because an evil witch lived there, but one day the witch saw them and lured them inside. The ducklings slept but the drake stayed awake, and when the witch called if they were asleep, the drake answered. But after two answers, the witch went in to see, and saw the ducklings were asleep, so she killed them.
The white duck found the bodies and lamented over them. The king wondered at it, and although the witch tried to persuade him it was nothing but quacking, he ordered that the duck be captured. His servants could not, but he went himself, and she flew to his hands and became a woman. She told of a bottle in the nest in the garden—or, they sent a magpie for magic water—which, sprinkled on the ducklings and drake, turned them into three lovely children.

One day, he decides to remarry, but marries a wicked queen who is a witch. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into magnificent swans, who are allowed to temporarily become human only at nights, and forces them to fly away. When their sister Elisa has reached the age of fifteen, the queen tries to bewitch her – but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has her banished after making her unrecognisable by dirtying her face. Elisa finds her brothers, who carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her evil stepmother.
There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the fairies to gather stinging nettles in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a vow of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her brothers. The handsome king of another faraway land happens to come across Elisa, who cannot talk, and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.
However, the archbishop is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of witchcraft. The statues of the saints shake their heads in protest, but the archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt.

The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the tumbril bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to continue up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and ripping the shirts into pieces when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent while she finishes the last shirt, but the executioner still prepares for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers return to their human forms. The youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt. Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth but faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and places it on Elisa's chest. She is revived by the white flower, and the king and Elisa are married."

They told her to give the cat ham, and it should show them a way from the woods; meanwhile, they would spin for her.  She went out, where her brother was trying to carry water. Wrens flew up and asked for some bread. They gave it, and the wrens advised him to stop up the holes with clay. They then gave the cat the ham.  It gave them a handkerchief and comb, which would become a river and a forest if they threw them behind them while they fled.
The next morning, the witch set the girl to weave, and the boy to chop wood into chips. Instead, they fled. A watch-dog sprung up, but they threw it the last of their bread. Birch trees nearly put out their eyes, but the girl tied a ribbon on their branches, and they let her by. Meanwhile, the cat was tangling the weaving, and when the witch saw it, she demanded to know why it had not stopped the children. It told her that she had never given it a bone, and they had given it ham.  The dog and the birch answered likewise, and she got her broom to follow.
The children threw down the handkerchief, but in time, the witch found a way to go around it. The children threw down the comb, and she could not force her way through it. They found their father again and he drove the stepmother out of the house."
the_witch_in_the_stone_boat,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_in_the_Stone_Boat,The Witch in the Stone Boat,"""The Witch in the Stone Boat"" (Icelandic: Skessan á steinnökkvanum 'the giantess in the stone boat') is an Icelandic folktale, originally collected by Jón Árnason (1864), translated into English in Andrew Lang's fairy tale collection The Yellow Fairy Book (1894).
The antagonist is a giantess (skessa; elsewhere called troll-woman, and revealed to be the sister of a three-headed giant), though rendered as ""witch"" by Lang, who shape-shifts and assumes the place of a queen, while having the true queen imprisoned. 
It has been categorized as a subtype of ATU 462, ""The Outcast Queens and the Ogress Queen"". 

","A king told his son Sigurd to marry, recommending a daughter of another king as prospective wife. Sigurd traveled to that kingdom and made his marriage proposal, and the bride's king agreed to the match, on condition that Sigurd would stay and help him as long as he could. Sigurd promised to remain, until such time as he received news of his father's death. When Sigurd learned of his father's death, he set sail for his homeland with his wife and their two-year-old son.
The ship was one day short of completing its journey when the wind died down. Sigurd was overcome with drowsiness and left the queen and his child alone on the deck. There approached a stone boat carrying a frightening ""witch"" (Lang. tr.) or ""troll-wife"" (Icelandic: tröllkona). The witch boarded ship, snatched away the baby and assumed the queen's place by transforming into her likeness and wearing the fine clothes she stripped from the queen. The imposter put the real queen on the stone boat, and spoke incantations to the boat telling it to go without straying to her brother in the underworld. The boat shot off and was soon out of sight from the ship. The disappearance of the real mother made the baby cry uncontrollably, and the witch's effort to quiet it was to no avail. So the witch went beneath deck and scolded Sigurd for leaving her alone on the deck. Such a temper tantrum was something Sigurd had never received from his wife, and it surprised him, but he thought she had an excusable reason this time. But for all the efforts of the two of them, they could not stop the boy from crying.

Sigurd was now the ruler of his homeland, succeeding his dead father. The little boy who used to be such a quiet child hardly stopped crying since that day, so he had to be given up to be raised by a wet nurse (or foster mother fostrá), one of the court ladies. Sigurd noticed his wife's change in temperament: she was now more ""haughty and stubborn, and difficult to deal with"".
But the fake queen's identity was to unravel. Two young courtiers who were in the habit of playing chess (actually Tafl games)in the room next to the queen eavesdropped and spied on her through a crack. They heard her say that the more widely she yawned, the more she transformed back into a troll, and even as she spoke, she gave a huge yawn, and reverted into the form of a hideous troll-wife. And through the floor of her room appeared her brother, a three-headed giant (þríhöfðaður þussi), who brought her a trough full of meat, which she devoured.Meanwhile, the boy-prince's wet nurse was about to witness the supernatural appearance of the true queen. When the wet nurse turned the [candle-]light on, several planks from the floor rose up, and from underneath appeared an astonishingly beautiful white-clad woman, dressed in linen. Clasped around her waist was an iron belt, with a chain leading down into the ground below. The queen embraced the child for a moment, and returned under the floor again. Her appearance was repeated the second night, and the nurse heard the queen say lamentfully that ""Two are gone, and one only is left,"" which the nurse guessed must mean that the third night would be her final appearance.
The next night, King Sigurd was in the nurse's room with a drawn sword in hand, awaiting the woman, whom he instantly recognized as his own wife. He cut the chain in two and great noises came from beneath the earth. The true queen now told her story. The three-headed giant had tried to force her to marry him (actually, to sleep with him), and at last she consented provided she could visit her son for three consecutive days, hoping for an opportunity to be liberated. The giant must have plummeted to death, the crashing ""caused by him in his death throes"". The real queen was then restored to all her dignity, and the king had the false queen immediately captured and stoned to death, her body torn apart by horses."
the_wizard_king,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_King,The Wizard King,"The Wizard King (Le Roi Magicien) is a French fairy tale published in Les fees illustres by the Chevalier de Mailly. Andrew Lang included it in The Yellow Fairy Book.

","A king was lord over many lands and had mastered magical secrets.  He married a princess, and they had a son.  The queen set out to seek her fairy godmother, as soon as the baby was strong enough, because she had been warned that her husband was a wizard, and wizards and fairies had long feuded.  Her fairy godmother gave him the gift of pleasing everyone and of learning quickly.  A few years later, the queen died, instructing her son to do nothing without consulting that fairy.
The king was grief-stricken.  Finally, as his familiar settings continually reminded him of his queen, he set out to foreign lands, using his arts to shapeshift into animals and so move about freely.  As an eagle, he saw a far country where the queen had a single daughter, astoundingly beautiful.  He carried her off and pleaded with her to marry him.  Although he installed her in a beautiful castle, with fine servants and a charming parrot for her pet, her capture had ensured that she would never be won over.  He kept her from his court, but one day thought that she might have heard of the charms of his son.  Fearing he was a rival, the king sent him on a journey.
The prince traveled until he came to the kingdom where the princess had been stolen from.  He was deeply moved by the story and resolved to rescue her, and went to the fairy for aid.  She declared that he could not reach the enchanted castle where the princess was, and the only expedient she could think of was to capture her parrot.  When the prince did this, the fairy turned the prince into an identical parrot.  In his new form, the prince reached the princess and, after seeing that she disliked his father the king, told her why he was there.
The fairy created a chariot, drawn by eagles, and had the captive parrot direct it to the castle.  There, the prince and princess escaped on it.  The king followed them to her mother's country, but when he tried to cast a magical potion on them, the fairy threw it back on him.  This allowed them to capture him and so strip him of his powers.  The prince asked for the king to be pardoned, and it was so. As the king took to the skies he vowed never to forgive his son or the fairy."
the_wolf_and_the_fox,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_and_the_Fox,The Wolf and the Fox,"""The Wolf and the Fox"" is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.  The story involves a greedy, gluttonous wolf living with a fox. The wolf makes the fox do all his work and threatens to eat him if he doesn't otherwise comply. The fox, in turn, devises a scheme to rid himself of the wolf.","A Wolf and a Fox are living together where the Fox (being the weaker of the two) is forced to do all the hard work for the Wolf. One day, the Wolf makes the Fox get him something to eat and the Fox says he knows where there are a couple of lambs. The Fox steals a lamb for the Wolf. But not content with just one, the Wolf goes back for more. He is caught by the farmer's men and thrown out after being severely beaten.
The next day, the Wolf again makes the Fox get him some food. The Fox says he knows of a house of the village where a woman is baking pancakes and steals some for the Wolf. Wanting more, the Wolf goes to the farm on his own, but causes a commotion which gets the woman's attention and is kicked out once again after she attacks him with her frying pan.
Some time later, the Wolf again makes the Fox get food. The Fox says he knows of a farmer's cellar where meat is being stored and leads the Wolf to the cellar. The wolf gobbles up the meat while the Fox also takes some but keeps checking to make sure he can still get out the way he came in. The Fox's constant scurrying gets the attention of the farmer who goes to investigate. The Fox is able to escape, but the Wolf has eaten so much that he can't get out and is eventually caught and killed by the farmer.
The Fox makes it back to the forest where he is pleased that he is free of the Wolf's services."
the_wolf_and_the_seven_young_goats,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_and_the_Seven_Young_Kids,The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats,"""The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats"" (German: Der Wolf und die sieben jungen Geißlein) is a fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in Grimm's Fairy Tales (KHM 5). It is of Aarne-Thompson type 123.The tale has obvious resemblance to ""The Three Little Pigs"" and other type 124 folktales. The rescue of the kids from the wolf's belly and his punishment by filling him with stones can also been compared to the rescue and revenge of Little Red Cap against the wolf (Aarne-Thompson type 333).

","A mother goat leaves her seven children at home while she ventures into the forest to find food. Before she leaves, she warns her young about the wolf who will try to sneak into the house and gobble them up. He will pretend to be their mother and convince the kids to open the door. The young children will be able to recognize their true mother by her white feet and sweet voice.
The mother goat leaves and the seven kids stay in the house. Before long, they hear a voice at the door that says ""Let me in children, your mother has something for each and every one of you."" It was the wolf, whose gruff voice betrays him and the kids do not let him in. The wolf goes to a marketplace, store, or pharmacy and steals some honey, medicine or chalk, to soften his voice. A little while later, the kids hear another voice at the door: ""Let me in children, your mother has something for each and every one of you."" This time the voice is high and sweet like their mother's. They are about to let him in when the youngest kid looks under the crack in the door and notices the wolf's big, black feet. They refuse to open the door, and the wolf goes away again.
The wolf goes to the bakery or mill and steals some flour, smearing it all over his coat, turning his black feet white. He returns to the children's house, and says ""Let me in children, your mother has something for each and every one of you."" The kids see his white feet and hear his sweet voice, so they open the door. The wolf jumps into the house and gobbles up six of the kids. The youngest child hides from the wolf in the grandfather clock and does not get eaten.
Later that day, the mother goat returns home from the forest. She is distraught to find the door wide open and all but one of her children missing. She looks around and sees the wolf, fast asleep under a tree. He has eaten so much, he cannot move. The mother goat calls to her youngest child to quickly get her a pair of scissors, a needle and some thread. She cuts open the wolf's belly and the six children spring out miraculously unharmed. They fill the wolf's belly with rocks, and the mother sews it back up again. When the wolf wakes up, he is very thirsty. He goes to the river to drink, but being so heavy he falls in and drowns under the weight of the rocks. All the children feel great to find themselves safe. The family lives happily ever after."
the_wolf_of_zhongshan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Zhongshan,The Wolf of Zhongshan,"The Wolf of Zhongshan (Chinese: 中山狼傳; pinyin: Zhōngshān Láng Zhuàn) is a popular Chinese fairy tale that deals with the ingratitude of a creature after being saved. The first print of the story is found in the Ming Dynasty Ocean Stories of Past and Present (Chinese: 古今說海; pinyin: Gǔjīn Shuōhǎi) published in 1544.

","The story is set during the late Spring and Autumn period.  King Jian Zi (趙簡子 - BC?-BC 476) was leading a hunting party through Zhongshan when he came across a wolf.  King Jian takes aim with his bow and arrow but misses and hits a stone instead.  The wolf desperately flees through the forest with the hunting party in pursuit.  As the wolf makes its way through the forest he stumbles upon a traveling Mohist scholar Mr. Dongguo (Chinese: 東郭先生; pinyin: Dōngguō Xiānshēng).  The wolf appeals to the scholar's belief of ""universal love"" and implores for his help. Mr. Dongguo takes pity on the creature and hides it in one of his book bags strapped to his donkey.
When the hunters approach him, Mr. Dongguo denies any knowledge of the wolf's whereabouts.  After the hunters had left, Mr. Dongguo lets the wolf out of his bag, gets on his donkey, and prepares to take his leave only to be stopped by the wolf.  The wolf now asks the scholar to save his life again, this time from starvation.  Mr. Dongguo offers the wolf some pastries, but the wolf smiles and said ""I don't eat those, I dine solely on meat"".  Puzzled, Mr. Dongguo inquires if the wolf intends to eat his donkey and the wolf replies ""No, no, donkey meat is no good"".  The donkey, upon hearing this, bolts from the scene as fast as its four legs to carry it leaving Mr. Dongguo behind with the wolf.  To Mr. Dongguo's surprise, the hungry wolf pounces on him and announces its intention to eat him.  When Mr. Dongguo protests at the wolf's ingratitude, the wolf presents the argument: since the scholar saved his life once why not do it again?  Now that it is starving, only by serving as the wolf's food will the scholar have fulfilled the act of saving his life.  The wolf also complains that it nearly suffocated while it was crammed in the scholar's bag and the scholar now owed him.  Dongguo and the wolf debated and finally decided to present their case to the judgment of three elders.
The first elder they present their argument to is an old withering apricot tree.  The tree relates its own experience to the two on how when it was young, children used to pick its fruits from its branches and the tree would tell them to eat their fill.  Now it was about to be chopped down to provide firewood.  The tree sides with the wolf.  The wolf is very pleased.
The second elder they present their argument to was an elderly water buffalo.  The buffalo tells its story of how it served its masters for many years dutifully providing him with milk and plowing his fields.  Now his master wants to butcher it so he can eat his meat.  The buffalo too sides with the wolf.  The wolf grins and feels even more justified in his request to eat the scholar.  Mr. Dongguo reminds the wolf that they have one more elder to seek out.
The last elder they present their argument to is an elderly farmer.  The farmer is sceptical and doesn't believe that the wolf can fit into the bag.  To illustrate its point, the wolf crawls back into the bag and right away the old farmer ties up the bag and starts to beat the wolf with his hoe.  The farmer bashes the wolf to an inch of his life then unties the bag and drags his dying wolf out of the bag.
Seeing the pitiful wolf the scholar thinks that the old farmer was too cruel but just then a weeping woman comes running towards them.  She points to the wolf and tells Mr. Dongguo and the farmer how it dragged off her little boy.  Mr Dongguo now no longer pities the wolf.  He picked up the hoe and strikes the final blow to the wolf's head."

","A woman, wishing to have no children, threw rocks into a well at a witch's direction.  Thereafter, she had no shadow.  Her husband, the parson, demanded to know why and threw her out, saying that their slate roof would blossom with flowers before she was forgiven.  One day, a beggar woman sought refuge there; she died in the night, the parson recognized her as his wife, and the housekeeper called him out to see how the roof had bloomed with flowers."
the_wonderful_birch,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Birch,The Wonderful Birch,"The Wonderful Birch (Russian: Чудесная берёза) is a Finnish/Russian fairy tale. A variant on Cinderella, it is Aarne–Thompson folktale type 510A, the persecuted heroine. It makes use of shapeshifting motifs. Andrew Lang included it in The Red Fairy Book.

","A peasant woman meets a witch, who threatens to transform her if she does something; she does not do it, but the witch turns her into a sheep anyway. The witch assumes the form of the peasant woman and goes home to her husband. After a time, she bears him a daughter. The witch pets and pampers her own daughter, and ill-treats her stepdaughter, the peasant's daughter by his sheep-wife.
The witch-stepmother tells her husband to slaughter the sheep before it runs away.  He agrees, but her stepdaughter hears and runs to the sheep, lamenting.  Her mother tells her not to eat anything made from her body but bury the bones.  She does so, and a birch tree grows on the grave.
The king gives a festival, inviting everyone, and the witch sends off the husband with her younger daughter, throws a potful of barleycorns in the hearth, and tells the older stepdaughter that if she does not pick barley corns from ashes, it will be worse for her.  The birch tells her to strike the hearth with one of her branches, which sorts them, and then magically bathes and dresses her. Then it told her to go to the fields and whistle, for a horse, partly gold, partly silver, and the third partly something more precious will appear to take her to the castle. The girl then goes into the festival.
The king's son falls in love with her, and has her sit beside him, but the witch's daughter gnaws bones under the table, and the king's son, thinking she is a dog, gives her such a kick to keep her away that her arm is broken.  He has the door latch smeared with tar, and when the stepdaughter leaves, her copper ring is caught in it.  When the witch returns home, she tells the stepdaughter that the king's son has fallen in love with her daughter and carries her about, only he had dropped her and broken her arm.
The king holds another festival.  The witch tries to keep her stepdaughter busy by throwing hemp-seed on the hearth, but the stepdaughter, with the birch's aid, goes to the festival as before. This time, the king's son breaks the witch's daughter's leg, and has the doorpost smeared with tar, so that her silver circlet is caught.
The king holds a third festival.  The witch tries to keep her stepdaughter busy by throwing milk on the hearth, but the stepdaughter, with the birch's aid, goes to the festival as before. This time, the king's son kicks out the witch's daughter's eye, and has the threshold smeared with tar, so that one of her golden slippers is caught.
The king's son then sets out to discover who the maiden was, with the circlet, ring, and the slipper. When he is about to try them on the stepdaughter, the witch intervenes and gets them on her daughter. He takes both the daughter and the stepdaughter, and when they came to a river, the stepdaughter whispers to the prince not to rob her of her silver and gold. He throws the witch's daughter over the river to serve as a bridge and he and the stepdaughter cross, and takes her for his bride. Then they visit the magical birch tree and get treasures and gifts. The tree vanishes soon after. While stretching as a bridge in her grief, the younger sister wishes that a hollow golden stalk grow out of her navel so that her mother would recognize her. Immediately a hollow golden stalk grows out of her on the bridge.
In time, the older stepsister delivers a son. The witch, hearing of this, and believing she is her daughter, goes to the castle, and on her way, seeing the golden stalk, is about to cut it. Her daughter cries out not to cut her navel, and that she is the bridge. The witch hurries to the castle and turns the older stepdaughter into a reindeer while the witch's daughter replaces her.
The king is told by an old widow that his wife is in the forest in the shape of a reindeer, and his present wife is the witch's daughter. When he asks how he can get her back, the widow tells him to let her take the child into the forest. When she goes for it, the witch objects, but the king's son insists on her taking it. In the forest, the widow sings to the reindeer, which then comes and suckles her child, and tells the woman to bring it again next day.
Next day, the witch again objects, but the widow takes it to the reindeer as before. The child becomes extremely beautiful, and its father asks the widow if it is possible for his wife to regain her human shape. The widow does not know, but tells him to go to the forest, and when the reindeer throws off its skin he is to burn it while she is searching his wife's head.
All this is done, and she resumes her human shape; but not liking to be seen naked, she turns into a spinning wheel, a washing-vat, and a spindle, all of which her husband destroys till she becomes human again. On their return to the castle, he orders a huge fire to be made under the bath with tar, and its approach to be covered with brown and blue cloth. Then he invites the witch's daughter to take a bath. She and her mother, in stepping over the cloth, fall a depth of three fathoms into the fire and tar to their death; the witch puts a curse on all mankind.In the ending to Andrew Lang's version of this fairy tale, after the older stepdaughter is turned back into a human, after being asked that she won't be eaten up, the witch and her daughter both run away, and if they have not stopped still, at a great age. The older stepdaughter, the prince, and the son all live happily ever after."

","Maurice Connor, a blind man, was the finest piper in Munster, and knew a tune that when he played, it forced everyone to dance.  One day at a wedding by the sea, he drank a great deal of whiskey, and foolishly began to play that tune.  Everyone, and every creature down to the crabs, scallops and oysters, began to dance.  A mermaid came dancing up out of the sea and persuaded him to marry her and live in the sea.  He promised his old mother to send, every year, a piece of burned wood to Trafraska to show he was alive and well.  
His mother died soon after the wedding, but the piece of burned wood drifted ashore every year for more than a century."
the_wonderful_wizard_of_oz,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is an American children's novel written by author L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W. W. Denslow. It is the first novel in the Oz series of books. A Kansas farm girl named Dorothy ends up in the magical Land of Oz after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their home by a tornado. Upon her arrival in Oz, she learns she cannot return home until she has destroyed the Wicked Witch of the West.The book was first published in the United States in May 1900 by the George M. Hill Company. In January 1901, the publishing company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000 copies, which quickly sold out. It had sold three million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956. It was often reprinted under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the successful 1902 Broadway musical adaptation as well as the classic 1939 live-action film.The ground-breaking success of both the original 1900 novel and the 1902 Broadway musical prompted Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books which serve as official sequels to the first story. Over a century later, the book is one of the best-known stories in American literature, and the Library of Congress has declared the work to be ""America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale.""","Dorothy Gale is a young girl who lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog, Toto, on a farm on the Kansas prairie. One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a cyclone that deposits them and the farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical silver shoes that originally belonged to the Wicked Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home to Kansas is to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her. As Dorothy embarks on her journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving her magical protection from harm.
On her way down the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held by a Munchkin named Boq. The next day, she frees a Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted joints of a Tin Woodman, and meets a Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard.
After several adventures, the travelers arrive at the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. He appears to Dorothy as a giant head, to the Scarecrow as a lovely lady, to the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and to the Lion as a ball of fire, with the intention of scaring them all, but of course choosing the wrong image to make the desired impression. He agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.
The Wicked Witch of the West sees the travelers approaching with her one telescopic eye. She sends a pack of wolves to tear them to pieces, but the Tin Woodman kills them with his axe. She sends a flock of wild crows to peck their eyes out, but the Scarecrow kills them by twisting their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they are killed while trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's straw hides the others. She sends a dozen of her Winkie slaves to attack them, but the Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses the power of her Golden Cap to send the Winged Monkeys to capture Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion. She cages the Lion, scatters the straw of the Scarecrow, and dents the Tin Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the witch's personal slave, while the witch schemes to steal her silver shoes.

The witch successfully tricks Dorothy out of one of her silver shoes. Angered, she throws a bucket of water at the witch and is shocked to see her melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed from her tyranny and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the witch's Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her friends back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and his band are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceress Gayelette from the North, and that Dorothy may use it to summon them two more times.
When Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, Toto tips over a screen in a corner of the throne room that reveals the Wizard, who sadly explains he is a humbug—an ordinary old man who, by a hot air balloon, came to Oz long ago from Omaha. He provides the Scarecrow with a head full of bran, pins, and needles (""a lot of bran-new brains""), the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Lion a potion of ""courage"". Their faith in his power gives these items a focus for their desires. He decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and then go back to Omaha in his balloon. At the send-off, he appoints the Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy goes after him, but the ropes holding the balloon break and the Wizard floats away.

Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys and tells them to carry her and Toto home, but they explain they can't cross the desert surrounding Oz. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers informs Dorothy that Glinda, the Good Witch of the South may be able to help her return home, so the travelers begin their journey to see Glinda's castle in Quadling Country. On the way, the Lion kills a giant spider who is terrorizing the animals in a forest. They ask him to become their king, which he agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys a third time to fly them over a hill to Glinda's castle.
Glinda greets them and reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes can take her anywhere she wishes to go. She embraces her friends, all of whom will be returned to their new kingdoms through Glinda's three uses of the Golden Cap: the Scarecrow to the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman to Winkie Country, and the Lion to the forest; after which the cap will be given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, freeing him and his band. Dorothy takes Toto in her arms, knocks her heels together three times, and wishes to return home. Instantly, she begins whirling through the air and rolling on the grass of the Kansas prairie, up to the farmhouse, though the silver shoes fall off her feet en route and are lost in the Deadly Desert. She runs to Aunt Em, saying ""I'm so glad to be home again!"""
the_yellow_dwarf,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Dwarf,The Yellow Dwarf,"The Yellow Dwarf (French: Le Nain jaune) is a French literary fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy.  Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book.

","A widowed queen spoiled her only daughter, who was so beautiful that kings vied for the honor of her hand, not believing they could attain it.  Uneasy that her daughter would never marry, the queen went to visit the Fairy of the Desert for advice.  She made a cake to protect herself from the lions that guarded the fairy, but she lost it.  A yellow dwarf offered to save her in return for her daughter's hand.  She accepted, but when the dwarf showed the miserable home in which her daughter would live, she grew quite ill.
Her daughter, distressed, went to seek the same fairy.  The dwarf told her what her mother had promised, and when she was ready to reject it, the lions arrived.  She agreed if he would save her.  Back at the castle, she fell quite ill and agreed to marry the King of the Gold Mines.  However, at the wedding, the Fairy of the Desert and the Yellow Dwarf interrupted.  The dwarf carried off the princess, and the fairy fell in love with the king and carried him off.  She chained him in a cave and turned herself into a beautiful woman, but her feet being unchanged, the king was able to tell who she was.  He told her that he would hate the fairy as long as she kept him chained up, but would love her if she freed him.  The Fairy of the Desert freed him and brought him to her castle, carrying him by the castle where the princess lived; she saw them and became convinced that the king was unfaithful to her.
The king was kept more pleasantly, but was unable to escape.  He lamented his fate along the sea, and a mermaid left enchanted sea rushes behind to look like his body and freed him.  She gave him a sword to fight his way to the princess.
The fairy was entirely deceived by the sea rushes and did not pursue him.
The king fought his way through sphinxes and dragons to find his path blocked by maidens with garlands of flowers; he still pressed on, tearing apart their garlands, and reached the princess.  He persuaded her of his fidelity, but the Yellow Dwarf found them and killed him.  The princess died of grief.
The mermaid was only able to change their bodies to two palm trees."
thirteenth__fairy_tale_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_(fairy_tale),Thirteenth (fairy tale),"""Thirteenth"" is an Italian fairy tale collected by Thomas Frederick Crane in Italian Popular Tales. It is Aarne-Thompson type 328, the boy steals the giant's treasures.

","A mother of thirteen sons motivates them to become fast runners, by arranging a competition each night: whoever reaches home first will enjoy the soup made from herbs their father has gathered. The youngest son, called Thirteenth, always wins, and as a result his brothers envy him and try to get rid of him. 
One day, the king promises a prize of gold for the hero who manages to steal the blanket of a giant in the vicinity. The brothers approach the king and tell him that Thirteenth boasts to be able to perform the feat. The king then asks that Thirteenth be brought before him, and demands that he do what he has bragged about. Thirteen, who never has pretended to be a monster slayer, protests, but to no avail. He has no choice but to head for the house of the giant.
The monster is out, and only his wife is at home, but Thirteenth sneaks inside and hides under the bed. At night, the giant returns, eats his supper and goes to bed, where he tells his wife he can smell a human, and wants to eat it. The giantess thinks he is stupid; there are no humans around, so the giant goes to sleep. During the night Thirteenth pulls at the blanket to try to steal it, but the giant is stirred. The boy mews like a cat, and the giant is calmed, and falls asleep again. Thirteenth then seizes the blanket quickly and runs out. The giant wakes again, and notices the sound of the thief’s steps.
After some time the king issues another reward if someone will bring him the giant’s horse. Thirteenth presents himself and asks for a silk ladder and a bag of cakes. At night he approaches the giant's stable. The horse neighs on seeing him, but Thirteenth calms it by offering it cake, and manages to ride it all the way to the king.
Then the king declares that he wants the giant’s bolster. Thirteenth protests, since the bolster is full of little bells, which makes it impossible to steal it and sneak away unnoticed. The king insists and Thirteenth departs. He creeps under the ogre's bed and waits for the couple to retire. At midnight the couple is asleep, and Thirteenth stretches out his hand for the bolster, but the bells chime and the giant wakes. The giant’s wife believes that it is the wind that has stirred them, and the giant seemingly agrees and goes back to sleep. In reality he is pretending, since he now feels that it is time to catch the burglar. When Thirteenth stretches out his hand for the bolster again, the giant seizes his arm.
To punish Thirteenth for his three crimes, the giant imprisons him in a barrel, fattening him up in order to eat him. Every few days the ogre feels Thirteenth’s finger, to measure the fattening process. The boy is steadily becoming fatter, and Thirteenth realises that his finger will reveal that he is fat enough for the giant to eat. He thus presents a mouse tail instead of the finger for the giant, who cannot tell, and believes the boy is not ready for slaughter. A few days later the giant wants to measure again, and this time Thirteenth uses a spindle to the same end. By the end of the month, Thirteenth cannot find anything else to use as a substitute for his finger, and had no choice but to stick it out. The giant is satisfied that the boy is fat enough, and calls his wife to prepare the boy for dinner, while he invites their relatives for the feast.
When the stove is heated, the giantess releases Thirteenth from the barrel, asking him to help her prepare a lamb for dinner. But Thirteenth understands that he is in fact the lamb, and tricks the giantess to fall into the oven. When she is cooked, Thirteenth carves her up and serves her legs as a meal; and places her upper body in the bed, with strings attached to the head and hands, covered under a blanket. 
When the relatives arrive, the giant finds the table ready, and goes to the bedroom to invite his wife to dinner: Thirteenth answers no, by pulling the strings, but one of the relatives come to look for them, and notices that something is not right with the giantess. Thirteenth escapes from under the bed and manages to steal the bolster and reach the king.
The king wants Thirteenth to complete his exploits by bringing back the giant himself. Thirteenth orders a very strong chest and disguises himself as a monk. At the giant's home, he pretends to be a man hunting for the evil Thirteenth to capture him in the chest. The monk asks the giant to test the strength of the chest, thus tricking the giant to climb into the chest. Thirteenth brings the giant to the king, who imprisons the giant, and rewards Thirteenth with all the riches and honour of the kingdom."
allerleirauh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousandfurs,Allerleirauh,"""Allerleirauh"" (English: ""All-Kinds-of-Fur"", sometimes translated as ""Thousandfurs"") is a fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm. Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 65. Andrew Lang included it in The Green Fairy Book.It is Aarne–Thompson folktale type 510B, unnatural love. Others of this type include ""Cap O' Rushes"", ""Donkeyskin"", ""Catskin"", ""Little Cat Skin"", ""The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter"", ""The She-Bear"", ""Mossycoat"", ""Tattercoats"", ""The Princess That Wore A Rabbit-Skin Dress"", ""Katie Woodencloak"", and ""The Bear"".  Indeed, some English translators of ""Allerleirauh"" titled that story ""Catskin"" despite the differences between the German and English tales.

","A king promised his dying wife that he would not re-marry unless it was to a woman who was as beautiful as she was, and when he looked for a new wife, he realized that the only woman that could match her beauty was his own daughter.
The daughter tried to make the wedding impossible by asking for three dresses, one as golden as the sun, one as silver as the moon, and one as dazzling as the stars, and a mantle made from the fur of every kind of bird and animal in the kingdom. When her father provided them, she took them, with a gold ring, a gold spindle, and a gold reel, and ran from the castle the night before the wedding.
She ran far away to another kingdom, and slept in a great forest there, but the young king of that place and his dogs found her while he was hunting. She asked the king to have pity on her and received a place in the kitchen, where she worked, and because she gave no name she was called ""All-Kinds-of-Fur.""
When the king held a ball, she snuck out and went to it in her golden dress. The next morning, the cook set her to make soup for the king, and she put her golden ring in it. The king found it and questioned the cook and then All-Kinds-of-Fur, but she revealed nothing. The next ball, she went dressed in her silver dress  and put the golden spindle in the soup, and the king again could discover nothing.
The third ball, she went in the star dress, and the king slipped a golden ring on her finger without her noticing it and ordered that the last dance go longer than usual. She was not able to get away in time to change; she was able only to throw her fur mantle over her clothing before she had to cook the soup. When the king questioned her, he caught her hand, seeing the ring, and when she tried to pull it away, her mantle slipped, revealing the dress of stars. The king pulled off the mantle, revealing her, and they married."
three_billy_goats_gruff,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Billy_Goats_Gruff,Three Billy Goats Gruff,"""Three Billy Goats Gruff"" (Norwegian: De tre bukkene Bruse) is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in their Norske Folkeeventyr, first published between 1841 and 1844. It has an Aarne-Thompson type of 122E.  The first version of the story in English appeared in George Webbe Dasent's translation of some of the Norske Folkeeventyr, published as Popular Tales from the Norse in 1859. The heroes of the tale are three male goats who need to outsmart a ravenous troll to cross the bridge to their feeding ground.","The story introduces three Billy goats (male goats), sometimes identified as a youngster, father and grandfather, but more often described as brothers. In other adaptations, there is a baby or child goat, mama goat and papa goat.  ""Gruff"" was used as their family name in the earliest English translation, by Dasent; the original Norwegian version used the name ""Bruse"".In the story, there is almost no grass left for them to eat near where they live, so they must cross a river to get to ""sæter"" (a meadow) or hillside on the other side of a stream to eat and fatten themselves up. They must first cross a wooden bridge, under which lives a fearsome and hideous troll, who is so territorial that he eats anyone who tries to cross the bridge.
The smallest billy goat is the first to cross and is stopped abruptly by the troll who threatens to ""gobble him up!"" The little goat convinces the troll to wait for his big brother to come across, because he is larger and would make for a more gratifying feast. The greedy troll agrees and lets the smallest goat cross.
The medium-sized goat passes next. He is more cautious than his brother but is also stopped by the troll and given the same threat. The second billy goat is allowed to cross as well after he tells the troll to wait for his father because he is the largest of the three.
The largest billy goat gets on the bridge but is also stopped by the hungry troll who threatens to devour him. The largest billy goat challenges the troll and dares him to do so. Then the troll jumps up. The big billy goat gruff knocks him off the bridge with his horns. The troll falls into the stream and is carried away by the current and drowned. From then on the bridge is safe and all three goats are able to go to the rich fields around the summer farm in the hills. The three billy goats Gruff eat lots of grass and live happily ever after."
thumbelina,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbelina,Thumbelina,"Thumbelina  (Danish: Tommelise) is a literary fairy tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen first published by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark, with ""The Naughty Boy"" and ""The Travelling Companion"" in the second instalment of Fairy Tales Told for Children. Thumbelina is about a tiny girl and her adventures with marriage-minded toads, moles, and cockchafers. She successfully avoids their intentions before falling in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size.
Thumbelina is chiefly Andersen's invention, though he did take inspiration from tales of miniature people such as ""Tom Thumb"". Thumbelina was published as one of a series of seven fairy tales in 1835 which were not well received by the Danish critics who disliked their informal style and their lack of morals. One critic, however, applauded Thumbelina. The earliest English translation of Thumbelina is dated 1846. The tale has been adapted to various media including television drama and animated film.","A woman yearning for a child asks a witch  for advice, and is presented with a barley which she is told to go home and plant (in the first English translation of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food). After the barleycorn is planted and sprouts, a tiny girl named Thumbelina (Tommelise) emerges from its flower.
One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later discards her when his friends reject her company.
Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements. When winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old field mouse and tends her dwelling in gratitude. Thumbelina sees a swallow who is injured while visiting a mole, a neighbor of the field mouse. She meets the swallow one night and finds out what happened to him. She keeps on visiting the swallow during midnight without telling the field mouse and tries to help him gain strength and she frequently spends time with him singing songs and telling him stories and listening to his stories in the winter until spring arrives. The swallow, after becoming healthy, promises that he would come to that spot again and flies away saying goodbye to Thumbelina.
At the end of winter, the mouse suggests Thumbelina marry the mole, but Thumbelina finds the prospect of being married to such a creature repulsive because he spends all his days underground and never sees the sun or sky, even though he is impressive with his knowledge of ancient history and lots of other topics. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, insisting the mole is a good match for her. Eventually Thumbelina sees little choice but to agree, but cannot bear the thought of the mole keeping her underground and never seeing the sun. 
However, at the last minute, Thumbelina escapes the situation by fleeing to a far land with the swallow. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia. In the end, the swallow is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself, who chronicles the story in a book."
timun_mas,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timun_Mas,Timun Mas,"Timun Mas or Timun Emas (English: ""The Golden Cucumber"") is a Javanese folktale telling the story of a brave girl that tries to escape and survive from an evil green giant that tried to catch and eat her.

","Once upon a time in Java, there was a poor widow named Mbok Srini that lived alone in her humble house on the edge of the jungle. She felt so lonely and prayed to the gods to bless her with a child. One night in her dream, she envisioned something wrapped under a tree of the jungle. She took this dream as an omen, an answer for her prayer. She later went to the jungle to search for something wrapped inside a cloth under a tree, she expected to find a baby to take care. Finally she discovered the object wrapped inside a cloth under the tree exactly as her vision in her dream. When she unwrapped it, there was no baby inside the wrapped cloth but only a seed of cucumber. Suddenly she heard a monstrous laughter; a green-skinned giant named Butho Ijo (in Javanese, means ""Green Giant"") appeared behind her. The green giant told her to plant the cucumber seed and she will have a child. She must nurture the child, however when the child had grown up, Mbok Srini must give the child back to Butho Ijo. The giant wished to eat the child. Eager to have a child, Mbok Srini agreed with Butho Ijo's deal.Mbok Srini returned to her home and planted the cucumber seed in an orchard behind her house. Later, a magical golden cucumber grew from its seed, and when Mbok Srini took the cucumber and opened it, a beautiful baby girl appeared inside it. Thus, she named the baby girl Timun Mas which means ""golden cucumber"". Year after year, Timun Mas grew to become a beautiful girl. She is a loving, kind and diligent child always willing to help and take care of an aging Mbok Srini. Just a week before Timun Mas' 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared in front of Mbok Srini's house and reminded her about her promise, and announces that within one week he will return to collect Timun Mas. Mbok Srini is so sad and fearful of the horrible fate that awaits her beloved child. Mbok Srini heard that there is a powerful rishi that resides in a mountain nearby. She hastily went to the mountain to seek help from a wise old hermit residing on said mountain. After hearing her story, the old hermit gave her four small bags of cloth with something inside it. The four objects inside the bags are cucumber seeds, needles, salts, and terasi (shrimp paste). The hermit told Mbok Srini to give these objects to Timun Mas and tell her to throw them when she is being chased by the giant. Mbok Srini returned home and told Timun Mas what to do if the green giant chased her.
A week before Timun Mas' 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared at Mbok Srini's house to take Timun Mas as promised: he will eat the girl. Mbok Srini ordered Timun Mas to run for her life. Timun Mas was really scared and terrified and ran as fast as she can to try to escape the giant. The giant was furious and destroyed Mbok Srini's house while chasing Timun Mas. Finally, Butho Ijo caught up to the fleeing Timun Mas. In distress, Timun Mas opened one of her four cloth bags spreading cucumber seeds behind her. Suddenly a large cucumber vine appeared and strangled the giant's body, trapping him so that he can’t move. This gave Timun Mas time to escape further. However the powerful giant finally managed to break free and continued his chase. Timun Mas opened her second bag and spread needles behind her. Suddenly the needles transformed into a bamboo forest with sharp tips that wounded the giant badly. The giant was badly wounded stuck with sharp bamboos, however he managed to get through the sharp bamboo forest and caught up to the running Timun Mas again. She opened her third bag and spread salts behind her back. Suddenly a sea appeared behind her drowning the evil giant. However the giant managed to swim through the sea and continued to chase her. Timun Mas, once again, almost got caught and opened her last bag. She threw the terasi behind her and continued to run desperately. Suddenly the terasi shrimp paste transformed into sea of boiling volcanic mud. Butho Ijo was stuck inside the boiling hot mud, drowned and died. Timun Mas finally survived and return to her mother Mbok Srini, and they lived happily ever after."
to_your_good_health_,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Your_Good_Health!,To Your Good Health!,"To Your Good Health! (Russian: Будь здоров!) is a Russian fairy tale.  Andrew Lang included it in The Crimson Fairy Book.

","Everyone in a king's country had to say ""To your good health!"" whenever he sneezed, but a shepherd with the staring eyes would not say it. The king summoned him and demanded it, but the shepherd would only say, ""To my good health.""  The chamberlain told him he would be killed if he did not, and the shepherd said that he would say it only if he married the princess.  The princess thought him handsome enough to marry, but the king was enraged.  He had the shepherd thrown in the white bear's pit, but the shepherd's eyes scared it off.  Then he had him thrown into a pit of wild boars, but the shepherd played a pipe and made them dance, so they did not harm him.  Then he was to have him thrown into a well of scythes, but the shepherd told the guard to give him a minute to look down the well, he might decide to say it after all, and in that minute, he whipped up a dummy that the soldier threw down instead of him.  
Then the king offered him a silver wood, a golden castle, and a diamond lake to say it, but the shepherd still said he would say it only he had the princess to wife.  The king married him to the princess.  At the wedding feast, he sneezed, and the shepherd said, first of all, ""To your good health!"" which so delighted the king that he did not mind the marriage.
In time, the shepherd succeeded the king.  He did not order his people to wish him well against their wills, but everyone did wish him well because he was a good king."
tom_thumb,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thumb,Tom Thumb,"Tom Thumb is a character of English folklore. The History of Tom Thumb was published in 1621 and was the first fairy tale printed in English. Tom is no bigger than his father's thumb, and his adventures include being swallowed by a cow, tangling with giants, and becoming a favourite of King Arthur. The earliest allusions to Tom occur in various 16th-century works such as Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft (1584), where Tom is cited as one of the supernatural folk employed by servant maids to frighten children. Tattershall in Lincolnshire, England, reputedly has the home and grave of Tom Thumb.Aside from his own tales, Tom figures in Henry Fielding's 1730 play Tom Thumb, a companion piece to his The Author's Farce. It was expanded into a single 1731 piece titled The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the History of Tom Thumb the Great.
In the mid-18th century, books began to be published specifically for children (some with their authorship attributed to ""Tommy Thumb""), and by the mid-19th century, Tom was a fixture of the nursery library. The tale took on moral overtones and some writers, such as Charlotte Mary Yonge, cleansed questionable passages. Dinah Mulock, however, refrained from scrubbing the tale of its vulgarities. Tom Thumb's story has been adapted into several films.","Richard Johnson's The History of Tom Thumbe of 1621 tells that in the days of King Arthur, old Thomas of the Mountain, a plowman and a member of the King's Council, wants nothing more than a son, even if he is no bigger than his thumb. He sends his wife to consult with Merlin. In three months' time, she gives birth to the diminutive Tom Thumb. The ""Queene of Fayres"" and her attendants act as midwives. She provides Tom with an oak leaf hat, a shirt of cobweb, a doublet of thistledown, stockings of apple rind, and shoes of mouse's skin.
Tom cheats at games with other boys and because of his many tricks, the boys will not associate with him. Tom retaliates by using magic to hang his mother's pots and glasses from a sunbeam. When his fellows try the same, their pots and glasses fall and are broken. Thereafter, Tom stays home under his mother's supervision. At Christmas, she makes puddings, but Tom falls into the batter and is boiled into one of them. When a tinker comes begging, Tom's mother inadvertently gives him the pudding containing her son. The tinker farts while crossing a stile, but Tom calls out about the farting and the frightened tinker drops the pudding. Tom eats himself free and returns home to tell his mother and father of his adventure.
His mother thereafter keeps a closer watch upon him. One day, he accompanies her to the field to milk the cows. He sits under a thistle, but a red cow swallows him. The cow is given a laxative and Tom passes from her in a ""cow turd"". He is taken home and cleaned. Another day, he accompanies his father for the seed sowing and rides in the horse's ear. Tom is set down in the field to play the scarecrow, but a raven carries him away. His parents search for him, but are unable to find him.
The raven drops Tom at the castle of a giant. The cruel giant swallows the tiny boy like a pill. Tom thrashes about so much in the giant's stomach that he is vomited into the sea. There, he is eaten once more by a fish which is caught for King Arthur's supper. The cook is astonished to see the little man emerge from the fish. Tom then becomes King Arthur's Dwarf.
Tom becomes a favorite at King Arthur's royal court, especially among the ladies. There is revelry; Tom joins the jousting and dances in the palm of a Maid of Honour. He goes home briefly to see his parents, taking some money from the treasury with the king's permission, then returns to court. The Queene of Fayres finds him asleep on a rose and leaves him several gifts: an enchanted hat of knowledge, a ring of invisibility, a shape-changing girdle, and shoes to take him anywhere in a moment.
Tom falls seriously ill when a lady blows her nose, but is cured by the physician to King Twaddell of the Pygmies. He takes a ride in his walnut shell coach and meets Garagantua. Each boasts of his many powers. When Garagantua threatens to harm Tom, he is cast under an enchantment and Tom hurries home to safety. King Arthur listens with amazement to Tom's many adventures.
Richard Johnson's 1621 narrative ends here, but he promised his readers a sequel that has never been found, if published at all. In 1630, a metrical version in three parts was published that continues Tom's adventures."
town_musicians_of_bremen,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_Musicians_of_Bremen,Town Musicians of Bremen,"The ""Town Musicians of Bremen"" (German: Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in Grimms' Fairy Tales in 1819 (KHM 27).It tells the story of four aging domestic animals, who after a lifetime of hard work are neglected and mistreated by their former masters. Eventually, they decide to run away and become town musicians in the city of Bremen. Contrary to the story's title the characters never arrive in Bremen, as they succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing their spoils, and moving into their house. It is a story of Aarne–Thompson Type 130 (""Outcast animals find a new home"").","In the story, a donkey, a dog, a cat, and a rooster, all past their prime years in life and usefulness on their respective farms, were soon to be discarded or mistreated by their masters. One by one, they leave their homes and set out together. They decide to go to Bremen, known for its freedom, to live without owners and become musicians there (""Something better than death we can find anywhere"").
On the way to Bremen, they see a lighted cottage; they look inside and see three robbers enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Standing on each other's backs, they decide to scare the robbers away by making a din; the men run for their lives, not knowing what the strange sound is. The animals take possession of the house, eat a good meal, and settle in for the evening.
Later that night, the robbers return and send one of their members in to investigate. He sees the cat's eyes shining in the darkness and thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. The robber reaches over to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the cat scratches his face with her claws, the dog bites him on the leg, the donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the rooster crows and chases him out the door. The terrified robber tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible witch who had scratched him with her long fingernails (the cat), a dwarf who has a knife (the dog), a black monster who had hit him with a club (the donkey), and worst of all, a judge calling out from the rooftop (the rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily for the rest of their days.
In the original version of this story, which dates from the twelfth century, the robbers are a bear, a lion, and a wolf, all animals featured in heraldic devices. When the donkey and his friends arrive in Bremen, the townsfolk applaud them for having rid the district of the terrible beasts. An alternate version involves the animals' master(s) being deprived of his livelihood (because the thieves stole his money and/or destroyed his farm or mill) and having to send his or their animals away, unable to take care of them any further. After the animals dispatch the thieves, they take the ill-gotten gains back to their master so he can rebuild. Other versions involve at least one wild, non-livestock animal, such as a lizard, helping the domestic animals out in dispatching the thieves."
trandafiru,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trandafiru,Trandafiru,"Trandafiru is a Romanian fairy tale collected by Arthur Carl Victor Schott and Albert Schott in the mid-19th century and sourced from Banat.
It is related to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband, albeit with a gourd instead of a snake as the form of the enchanted husband.

","A man has a gourd for a son, who is a vegetable by day and man by night, named Trandafiru. One day, the gourd asks his parents to go and ask for the hand of the emperor's daughter. Worried about the reaction of the emperor when they see a pumpkin, the gourd son assuages their fears and becomes a man when night falls, so he can meet the princess. And so it happens: the emperor's daughter marries him and lives with him, despite him being a gourd by day and a man by night.
One day, the princess's mother visits her daughter and, despising the gourd as her son-in-law, convinces her to burn the gourd shape in the oven. The princess's mother-in-law asks her what is she doing with the oven, and she lies that she is preparing to make bread, then takes her husband's gourd shape and places it in the oven to burn it. Inside the oven, Trandafiru's voice curses his wife not to give birith to their child, until he lovingly embraces her again. The story then explains that, as the gourd burned, Trandafiru's soul was carried over by spirits to another kingdom, where he became their king.
Back to the princess, after grieving for some time, she puts an iron circle around her belly to endure the pains of the long pregnancy, then departs on her quest. Her first stop is the house of Holy Mother Wednesday, who, despite not knowing the location of Trandafiru, gives the princess a golden distaff and sends her to the house of Mother Holy Friday. Again, Holy Friday's help is of little use, but she gives the princess a golden reel to help in her quest. Lastly, the princess arrives at Holy Mother Sunday's house. Holy Mother Sunday tells the princess she is near her husband's location, and advises her to stand by the marble fountain with the golden gifts, one for each day, and draw the attention of the Empress (the false bride), then use the gifts to bribe the Empress for a night in the Emperor's (Trandafiru's) bedchamber. Before the princess goes to the fountain, Holy Mother Sunday gives her a golden hen with golden chicks.
Now knowing what to do, the princess goes to the fountain and uses the gifts to bribe the Empress for three nights with her husband. As for Trandafiru, he is put to sleep for two nights with a sleeping potion given by the Empress, so on the third night he pretends to be asleep to see who has come to his room for the past nights. Trandafiru awakes and embraces his wife, who is able to give birth to ""two golden children"". Trandafiru leaves the room to punish the Empress for her greed and love for gold, then crowns the princess his true empress."

A version of the tale also appears in A Book of Ogres and Trolls, by Ruth Manning-Sanders. That version is said to come from Iceland.

","A king's beautiful daughter vanished without a trace.  The king proclaimed that whoever returned with her could marry her.
Near, a peasant couple had three sons; the older two were indulged, and the youngest always had to give way to his brothers.  The oldest set out to seek his fortune.  He refused food to two beggars and threw stones at birds that looked for crumbs.  He went to sleep in a cave, but an ogress returned.  She agreed to let him stay only if he would do a task in the morning, and then she set him to sweep out the cave.  The dirt would not move, and the ogress hit him over the head, killing him.  And the second brother followed and met the same fate.
The parents continued to mistreat their youngest, so he also set out.  He gave some food to the first beggar, who told him to call his name, Tritill, if he needed help, and the same with the second, Litill, and he crumbed some of his bread for the birds, who also told him to call for help.  He found the same cave and realized from bones and scraps of cloth that it was an ogress's lair, but remained.  When she set him to sweep the floor, he called on Tritill, who did it for him.
The next day, the ogress set him to spread the feathers from her pillows to dry them and put them all back.  He spread them out, a breeze carried them off, and he called on Tritill, Litill, and the birds.  They put the feathers back.
The next day, the ogress set him to slaughter one of her fifty oxen, but she would not tell him which one.  He called on Tritill and Litill, who slaughtered one and told him to ask for what lay on the bed, the chest at her bed's foot, and what lay under the cave's side.  These proved to be the princess, a chest filled with gold and jewels, and a magical ship that moved over land and sea.  He brought this all to the king, who agreed to the marriage."
true_and_untrue,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_and_Untrue,True and Untrue,"True and Untrue is a Norwegian fairy tale collected by Asbjørnsen and Moe.  It is Aarne-Thompson type 613, The Two Travelers: Truth and Falsehood.

","Two brothers were known as True and Untrue for their natures.  They set out to seek their fortunes.  Untrue persuaded True to let them both eat True's food first, and when that was eaten, refused True any of his.  True said that it showed Untrue's nature, and Untrue gouged his brother's eyes out.
True fumbled along through the woods until he came to a lime tree.  He decided to spend the night in it for fear of wild animals.  A bear, wolf, fox, and hare met under it, because it was St. John's Eve.  The bear said that the dew on the lime tree would cure the sight of the king, who was going blind; the wolf said that the king's daughter was deaf and dumb because when she went to communion, she let a crumb fall, but if they caught the toad that had swallowed it, she would be cured; the fox told how the king could find a spring in his courtyard; and the hare told how a golden chain buried about the king's orchard kept it from bearing fruit.
At dawn, True rubbed his eyes with the dew, and regained his sight.  He went to serve the king and put to use everything the animals had said, ending with restoring the princess's speech and hearing, at which the king married him to the princess and gave him half his kingdom.
At the wedding, a beggar came:  Untrue.  True gave him some food and told him to go sit in the lime tree, but when the animals came, they knew that someone had overheard all they said, so this year, they did not do more than say good night and part."
trusty_john,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusty_John,Trusty John,"""Trusty John"", ""Faithful John"", ""Faithful Johannes"", or ""John the True"" (German: Der treue Johannes) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in Grimm's Fairy Tales in 1819 (KHM 6). Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book.It is Aarne-Thompson type 516.  Others of this type are Father Roquelaure and The Raven.  Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson catalogued about 500 tales under this type, of which over 200 were Irish, and the remainder, from the rest of Europe and European colonies in America.  Such tales include In Love with a Statue, How to find out a True Friend, The Man of Stone, and Amis et Amiles.","In some variants, a king on his deathbed orders his servant, Trusty John, not to let his son see a certain room, which holds a portrait of a princess.
In all variants, when the new king comes to power, he forces his way into the room.  Instantly, he falls in love with the princess.  In Joseph Jacobs's version, her country had been at war with his, and the portrait stems from betrothal negotiations that had fallen through; but in all versions, the king does not know how to win her.  Trusty John tells him to prepare a ship with all manner of rich treasure, and then either sails with it himself, or has the king sail with him, to her country.  The princess is lured aboard by the goods, and the ship sets sail, carrying her off.
While they travel, John hears three ravens.  One says that as soon as they reach shore, a horse will come; if the king mounts it, it will fly into the air with him, and neither will be seen again. The solution is for someone to kill the horse, but anyone who reveals this by stating it out loud would have his legs turn to stone up to the knees. The second raven says (with variations in different tellings) that the king would be killed by wine at the wedding feast if it were not dashed to the ground, or that he would be incinerated by a wedding shirt if it was not destroyed by a glove-wearing person, etc.; in all variants, whoever says so would turn to stone to his waist.  The third raven says, again in different variants, that the princess would faint and die unless someone draws three drops of blood from her right breast; or a dragon would attack their bridal chamber and unless driven off, kill them. True to form, whoever states this would turn entirely to stone.

John prevents all three fates. For the first two, the king trusts that John has acted in his service; but for the third, the king decides to execute him.  At the place of execution, John tells the story of the ravens and turns progressively to stone.
In time, the queen bears twin sons. The king learns that if he kills the boys and rub John's statue with their blood, he would come to life again. The king does this, and upon John's resurrection, he does the same to the boys and resurrects them. Later, John and the twins hide in a closet as the king explains what would need to be done to bring John back to test her loyalty. When the queen agrees to the sacrifice, John and the twins emerge from the door and embrace everyone. The king and queen live happily until their deaths."

Others of this type include ""The Golden Bird"", ""The Greek Princess and the Young Gardener"", ""The Bird 'Grip'"", ""How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon"", and ""The Nunda, Eater of People"".

","A king's apple tree bore golden apples, but every night, one was stolen. Guards reported that the Firebird stole them.  The king told his two oldest sons that the one who caught the bird would receive half his kingdom and be his heir.  They drew lots to see who would be first, but both fell asleep; they tried to claim it had not come, but it had stolen an apple.  Finally Ivan Tsarevich, the youngest son, asked to try; his father was reluctant because of his youth but consented.  Ivan remained awake the entire time, and upon seeing the bird, tried to catch it by the tail.  Unfortunately, Ivan only managed to grasp one feather.  The Firebird did not return, but the king longed for the bird.  He said that still, whoever caught it would have half his kingdom and be his heir.

The older brothers set out. They came to a stone that said whoever took one road would know hunger and cold; whoever took the second would live, though his horse would die; and whoever took the third would die, though his horse would live. They did not know which way to take, and so took up an idle life.

Ivan begged to be allowed to go until his father yielded. He took the second road, and a wolf ate his horse. He walked until he was exhausted, and the wolf offered to carry him. It brought him to the garden where the firebird was and told him to take it out without touching its golden cage. The prince went in, but thought it was a great pity not to take the cage, but when he touched it, bells rang, waking everyone, and he was captured. He told his story, and the First King said he could have had it for the asking, but he could be spared now only if he could present the king with the Horse with the Golden Mane.
He met the wolf and admitted to his disobedience. It carried him to the kingdom and stables where he could get the horse and warned him against the golden bridle. Its beauty tempted him, and he touched it, and instruments of brass sounded. He was captured, and the Second King told him that if he had come with the word, he would have given him the horse, but now he would be spared only if he brought him Helen the Beautiful to be his wife.
Ivan went back to the wolf, confessed, and was brought to her castle. The wolf carried her off, but Ivan was able to assuage her fears. Ivan brought her back to the Second King, but wept because they had come to love each other. The wolf turned itself into the form of the princess and had Ivan exchange it for the Horse with the Golden Mane. Ivan and Helen rode off on the Horse. The wolf escaped the king. It reached Ivan and Helen, and Helen rode the horse and Ivan the wolf.  Ivan asked the wolf to become like the horse and let him exchange it for the Firebird, so that he could keep the horse as well. The wolf agreed, the exchange was done, and Ivan returned to his own kingdom with Helen, the horse, and the Firebird.
The wolf said its service was done when they returned to where it had eaten Ivan's horse.  Ivan dismounted and lamented their parting.  They went on for a time and slept.  His older brothers found them, killed Ivan, sliced his body to pieces, and told Helen that they would kill her if she would not say that they had fairly won the horse, the firebird, and her.  They brought them to their father, and the second son received half the kingdom, and the oldest was to marry Helen.
The Grey Wolf found Ivan's body and caught two fledgling crows that would have eaten it.  Their mother pleaded for them, and the wolf sent her to fetch the water of death, which restored the body, and the water of life, which revived him.  The wolf carried him to the wedding in time to stop it; the older brothers were made servants or killed by the wolf, but Ivan married Helen and lived happily with her."
udea_and_her_seven_brothers,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udea_and_her_Seven_Brothers,Udea and Her Seven Brothers,"""Udea and her Seven Brothers"" is a Northern African (Libyan) fairy tale collected by Hans Stumme in Märchen und Gedichte aus der Stadt Tripolis. Scottish novelist Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book.It is Aarne-Thompson-Uther type ATU 451, ""The Maiden Who Seeks her Brothers"".

","A man and wife had seven sons.  One day, the sons set out hunting and told their aunt that if their mother had a daughter, to wave a white handkerchief, and they would return at once; but if a son, a sickle, and they would keep on.  It was a daughter, but the aunt wished to be rid of the boys, so she waved a sickle.  The daughter, Udea, grew up not knowing about her brothers.  One day, an older child taunted her for driving her brothers away, who were forever roaming the world; she questioned her mother and set out to find them.  Her mother gave her a camel, some food, a cowrie shell about the camel's neck as a charm, an African, Barka, and his wife to take care of her.  On the second day, Barka told Udea to get off the camel so that his wife could ride in her place.  The mother was close by and told Barka to leave Udea alone. On the third day, Barka again told Udea to let his wife ride the camel in her place, but the mother was now too far away to hear and command Barka.  Udea called out for her mother to no avail and Barka threw the girl to the ground.  The wife climbed onto the camel and Udea walked on the ground, her bare feet cut up because of the stones on her path.
One day, they passed a caravan, where they were told of the castle where the brothers lived.  Barka let Udea ride the camel to the castle, but smeared her with pitch, so that her brothers would not recognize her. However, they accepted her without question.  Her tears of joy left white marks on her face.  One alarmed brother took a cloth and rubbed the mark until the pitch was gone.  The brother asked her who had painted her skin black, to which she would not answer, in fear of Barka's anger.  She finally relented, describing the treatment she received during her travels.  The seven brothers were outraged and beheaded both Barka and his wife.
The brothers went hunting for seven days, instructing Udea to lock herself in the castle with only the cat who grew up in the house.  She would follow the cat's advice in all matters and eat nothing that the cat did not eat.  They returned, and found her well.  The brothers then told her of the castle elves and pigeons, who could be called to fetch the brothers in case Udea was in any danger.  The pigeons had seven days' worth of food and water left by the brothers during each hunting trip; Udea asked why they did not have her feed the pigeons daily, because the food they had laid out was old after seven days.  They agreed and told her any kindness towards the pigeons would be considered a kindness towards themselves.
On the brothers' third hunting trip, Udea was cleaning the castle and, forgetting her instructions for a moment, found a bean and ate it.  The cat demanded half.  Udea said she could not, because she had already eaten it, and offered one hundred other beans.  The cat only wanted the bean that Udea had eaten.  To punish the girl, the cat put out the fire in the kitchen.  With no way of cooking, Udea climbed up the castle, saw a fire in the distance and left to find its source.  She asked for a lump of burning coal from the elderly man tending the fire, but he was in fact a ""man-eater"" (cannibal) and demanded a strip of blood from her ear to her thumb in return.  She bled all the way home, and did not notice the raven that had followed her back until she came upon the castle door.  Startled, she cursed the raven, hoping to startle it as well.  It asked why she would wish harm to one that had done her a favor.  It flew off, along with the dirt it had used to cover her trail of blood.  The man-eater followed this path to the castle and broke six doors in six nights, intending to attack and eat Udea.  On the last day, with only one door in place, she sent a letter to her brothers with the help of the castle pigeons.  The brothers immediately came home and trapped the man-eater in a burning pit.
As the man-eater burned, only one of his fingernails was left behind.  It was blown towards and stabbed Udea under her own fingernail.  She collapsed, lifeless.  Her brothers put her on a bier and the bier on a camel, and set it off to their mother.  They ordered the camel to avoid capture and stop only when someone said, ""string.""  During the journey, three men chased after the camel, but only when one said that his sandal string was broken did it stop.  The man took Udea's hand and attempted to pull off her ring.  This motion freed the man-eater's fingernail from her hand, and she woke up full of life.  The camel returned her to her joyful brothers, and all the siblings set out to see their parents once again.
On the fourth day of their reunion, the eldest brother told their parents of their aunt's treachery and the adventures they had encountered."
ureongi_gaksi,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureongi_gaksi,Ureongi gaksi,"Ureongi gaksi (Korean: 우렁이 각시, The Snail Bride) is a Korean folktale about a poor man who breaks taboo and marries a maiden who comes out of a snail shell until he loses his snail bride when a magistrate kidnaps her. The tale features an inter-species marriage in which a snail transforms into a woman and becomes the bride of a male human. The tale also depicts the motif of a government official from the ruling class taking away a woman in a relationship with a lower-class male civilian.","Once upon a time, there was a man living with his mother for he was too poor to find a wife. One day, while working in a rice paddy, the man grumbled to himself, “Who will I eat this rice with?” Then he heard a voice reply, “With me.” Startled, he once more asked, “Who will I eat this rice with?” and the voice again answered, “With me.” The man looked around to find nothing but a snail shell at the edge of the rice paddy, so he brought it home and kept it in a water jar. From that day on, when mother and son came back home from work each day, a delicious meal would be prepared for them. Curious to find out who was cooking, the man pretended to leave for work one day and crept back to keep an eye on the house. He then saw a beautiful maiden emerge from the snail shell to prepare a meal. The man jumped out, ran over to the maiden, and asked her to live with him instead of going back into the snail shell. The maiden told him it was not yet time, but the impatient man kept begging her to stay so that the two became husband and wife on that very day.
Fearing that his wife might be taken away from him, the husband never let her leave the house. Whenever she prepared lunch for her husband, her mother-in-law would deliver it to her son working in the field. One day, the mother-in-law wished to stay home to enjoy some crispy leftover rice, so she asked her daughter-in-law to deliver lunch to her son. On her way to her husband, however, the snail bride ran into the magistrate’s procession. She quickly hid in the woods, but the magistrate spotted the radiance from her body among the trees. Smitten by her beauty, the magistrate took her away in a palanquin to make her his bride. The husband ultimately failed to find his wife although he went to the magistrate’s office looking for her, which caused him to die of despair and become reborn as a blue bird. The kidnapped snail bride refused to eat and disobeyed the magistrate until she too died and turned into a fine-toothed comb."
vasilisa_the_beautiful,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasilissa_the_Beautiful,Vasilisa the Beautiful,Vasilisa the Beautiful (Russian: Василиса Прекрасная) or Vasilisa the Fair is a Russian fairy tale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in Narodnye russkie skazki.,"By his first wife, a merchant had a single daughter, who was known as Vasilisa the Beautiful. When the girl was eight years old, her mother died; when it became clear that she was dying, she called Vasilisa to her bedside, where she gave Vasilisa a tiny, wooden, one-of-a-kind doll talisman, with explicit instructions; Vasilisa must always keep the doll somewhere on her person and never allow anyone (not even her father) to see it or even know of its existence; whenever Vasilisa should find herself in need of help, whenever overcoming evil, obstacles, or just be in need of advice or just some comfort, all that she needs to do is to offer it a little to eat and a little to drink, and then, whatever Vasilisa's need, it would help her. Once her mother had died, Vasilisa offered it a little to drink and a little to eat, and it comforted her in her time of grief.

After the mourning period, Vasilisa's father, in need of a mother for Vasilisa and to keep house, decided he needed to remarry; for his new wife, he chose a widow with two daughters of her own from her previous marriage, thinking that she would make the perfect new mother figure for his daughter. However, Vasilisa's step-mother was very cruel to her, as were Valilisa's step-sisters, but with the help of the doll, Vasilisa was always able to perform all the household tasks imposed on her. When Vasilisa came-of-age and young men came trying to woo her, the step-mother rejected them all on the pretence that it was not proper for younger girls to marry before the older girls, and none of the suitors wished to marry Vasilisa's step-sisters.
One day, the merchant had to embark on an extended journey out of town for business. His wife, seeing an opportunity to dispose of Vasilisa, sold the house on the same day he left and moved them all away to a gloomy hut by a forest where rumour said that Baba Yaga resided. When not over-working Vasilisa with housework, the step-mother would also send her out deep into the woods on superfluous errands, with the intentions of either marring her step-daughter's enduring beauty or increasing the chances Baba Yaga discovering her and eating her, keeping the step-mother's hands clean of any perceived culpability.  Only thanks to the doll was Vasilisa able to keep completing the scores of housework and remain safe whenever out of the house, always returning unharmed.  The step-mother, only becoming frustrated with how her step-daughter's continued luck, not only in remaining alive, but also in how Vasilisa's beauty continued to grow, decided to change tactics.  One night, before bed, she gave each of the girls a task and put out all the fires except a single candle. Her older daughter then put out the candle (as instructed by her mother), whereupon the step-sisters bodily forced Vasilisa out of the house and demanded that she goes to fetch light from Baba Yaga's Hut.

The doll advised her to go, and she went.  While she was walking, a mysterious man rode by her in the hours before dawn, dressed in white, riding a white horse whose equipment was all white; then a similar rider in red. She came to a house that stood on chicken legs and was walled by a fence made of human bones.  A black rider, like the white and red riders, rode past her, and night fell, whereupon the eye sockets of the skulls began to glow, like lanterns. Vasilisa was too frightened to run away, and so Baba Yaga found her when she arrived in her giant, flying mortar.  Once she learned why the girl was there, Baba Yaga said that Vasilisa must perform tasks to earn the fire, or be killed; she was to clean the house and yard, wash Baba Yaga's laundry, and cook her a meal enough for a dozen (which Baba Yaga eats all by herself). She was also required to separate grains of rotten corn from sound corn, and separate poppy seeds from grains of soil. Baba Yaga left the hut for the day and Vasilisa despaired, as she worked herself into exhaustion. When all hope of completing the tasks seemed lost, the doll whispered that she would complete the tasks for Vasilisa, and that the girl should sleep.
At dawn, the white rider passed; at or before noon, the red. As the black rider rode past, Baba Yaga returned and could complain of nothing. She bade three pairs of disembodied hands seize the corn to squeeze the oil from it, then asked Vasilisa if she had any questions.
Vasilisa asked about the riders' identities and was told that the white one was Day, the red one the Sun, and the black one Night. But when Vasilisa thought of asking about the disembodied hands, the doll quivered in her pocket. Vasilisa realized she should not ask, and told Baba Yaga she had no further questions. In return, Baba Yaga enquired as to the cause of Vasilisa's success. On hearing the answer ""by my mother's blessing"", Baba Yaga, who wanted nobody with any kind of blessing in her presence, threw Vasilisa out of her house, and sent her home with a skull-lantern full of burning coals, to provide light for her step-family.
Upon her return, Vasilisa found that, since sending her out on her task, her step-family had been unable to light any candles or fire in their home. Even lamps and candles that might be brought in from outside were useless for the purpose, as all were snuffed out the second they were carried over the threshold. The coals brought in the skull-lantern burned Vasilisa's stepmother and stepsisters to ashes, and Vasilisa buried the skull according to its instructions, so no person would ever be harmed by it.Later, Vasilisa became an assistant to a maker of cloth in Russia's capital city, where she became so skilled at her work that the Tsar himself noticed her skill; he later married Vasilisa."

","A woman had three daughters.  One day, one picked a pink carnation and vanished.  The next day, the second, searching for her sister, picked a rose and vanished.  The third day, the third picked some jessamine and vanished.  The woman bewailed this so long that her son, just a boy when his sisters vanished, grew up to be a man.  He asked what had happened, and his mother told him of his sisters.  He asked for her blessing and set out to find them.
He found three big boys fighting over their inheritance:  boots with which the wearer could wish himself anywhere, a key that opened every lock, and an invisibility cap.  The son said he would throw a stone and whoever got it first would have all three.  He threw it and stole the things, wishing himself where his oldest sister was.  He found himself before a strong castle on a mountain.  His key unlocked all the doors.  He found his sister richly dressed, and having only one unhappiness:  her husband was under a curse until a man who could not die, died.  Her husband returned; the son put on his cap, and a bird flew in and became a man.  He was angry that she had hidden someone from him, but the son took off his cap, and their resemblance convinced him that they were indeed brother and sister.  He gave him a feather that would let him call on him, the King of the Birds.
The next day, he saw his second sister, whose only trouble was the spell that kept her husband half his day a fish.  Her husband, the king of the fish, gave him a scale to call on him.

The next day, he saw his youngest sister, who had been carried off by a monster, and was weeping and thin from its cruelty, because she had refused to marry it.  Her brother asked her to say she would marry it, if it told her how it could die.  When she did, it told her that an iron casket at the bottom of the sea, had a white dove, and the dove's egg, dashed against its head, would kill it.  The brother had the king of the fishes bring him the box, used the key to open it, had the king of the birds bring him the dove after it flew off, and carried off the egg.  The youngest sister asked the monster to lay its head in her lap.  Her brother smashed the egg on its head, and it died.
His two brothers-in-law resumed their shape, and they sent for their mother-in-law.  The treasures of the monster made the youngest sister rich all her life."

Andrew Lang included it in The Brown Fairy Book (1904), with the note ""Translated from two Persian MSS. in the possession of the British Museum and the India Office, and adapted, with some reservations, by Annette S. Beveridge.""

","A king had three sons. The oldest went hunting and chased a deer, giving orders that it should be captured rather than killed. It led him to a sandy waste where his horse died.  He found a tree with a spring beneath it and drank. A faqir asked him what he did there. He told him his story and asked the faqir's,  repeating when the faqir put him off, until the faqir told him he had been a king, and his seven sons had all tried to win a princess whose hand could only be won by answering the riddle, ""What did the rose do to the cypress?"" and died for their failure.  His grief sent him into the desert.
This inspired the son with a love for the same princess. His attendants found him and brought him back, but he grew ill for love, and his confidants found this out and revealed it to the king. The king made arrangements for him to go.  At the city, the princess's father tried to dissuade him. He was asked, failed, and was executed. His second brother followed and likewise died.
Finally the third went, but having reached the city, he saw his brothers' heads and went to a nearby village, where he took shelter with an ancient, childless couple. Disguising himself, he searched the city for the secret, and found he could get into the princess's garden by a stream. There he hid, but when the princess sent her maids for water, they saw his reflection and were terrified. The princess had her nurse bring him to her. He answered her questions at random, convincing her that he was mad, but his beauty made her protect him as her own. Dil-aram, who had seen him first, grew fond of him and begged him to tell her what he was about; finally, he was convinced she was in love with him, told her his story, and promised to marry her and keep her among his favorites. She could not answer the riddle, but knew that a certain African from Waq of the Caucasus had told the princess it.
The prince set out to Waq of the Caucasus. An old man advised him on how to arrive there, despite the jinns, demons, and peris. He should take this road until it split, then take the middle road for a day and a night, where he would find a pillar. He should do what was written on the pillar. He found a warning where the roads split, against the middle road, but took it and came to a garden. He had to pass a giant man to reach it, and a woman there tried to persuade him from his way. When she failed, she enchanted him into a deer.
As a deer, he came to lead a band of deer. He tried to jump from the enchanted garden but found that it would bring him back where he had jumped from. The ninth time, however, the other deer vanished. A beautiful woman there took him as a pet. He wept, and the woman realized he had been enchanted by her sister. She turned him back, gave him a bow and arrows, a sword, and a dagger, that had all belonged to heroes, and told him that he must seek out the home of the Simurgh, but she could not direct him to it.
He obeyed her directions about the Place of Gifts, where wild animals lived, and a lion-king gave him some hairs, saying he must burn them for aid. He disobeyed her directions to avoid the castle of clashing swords, because whatever was fated to happen to him would happen, and fought the people there. With the lion's aid, he defeated them, rescuing a princess, and gave it all into the lion's care until he was done with his quest.
He found the Simurgh's nest, where only the young ones were, and killed a dragon there; then he fed the hungry young birds on it, and they slept, being full. When their parents returned, the lack of noise convinced them that the prince had killed and eaten their young, but the mother bird insisted on checking to discover the truth, and the young ones woke. The Simurgh carried him to Waq, and gave him three feathers, any of which would summon him.
At Waq, he learned that only the king knew the riddle and went to court.  He gave the king a diamond and said it was his last treasure. The king wished to please him, but the prince wanted only the answer to the riddle. When he asked, the king said he would have killed anyone else, but when the king went on asking what the prince wanted, the prince refused to ask for anything.  Finally, the king told him that he could have what he wanted, if he consented to die afterward. He was the cypress, and his wife, whom he had brought before them in chains and rags, was the rose. He had once rescued peris and restored their sight, and in return, they had arranged for his marriage to a peri princess. She had betrayed him, riding off every night to a man who beat her. The king had killed him and his fellows, except the one who escaped to tell the princess with the riddle.  He then told the prince to prepare for execution.  The prince asked only for a final washing, but when washing, he summoned the Simurgh, and it carried him off.
He returned.  On the way, he married the princess from the castle of clashing swords, and the woman who had disenchanted him.  At the city, he demanded the African whom the princess hid beneath her throne to confirm the truth of his words.  He told the story, and the king having found the African, he confirmed it.  Instead of marrying the princess, he took her captive, had the head decently buried, and sent for Dil-aram.
At home, the prince had the African torn apart between four horses.  The princess begged for mercy; those who had died had been fated to die, and it was her fate to be his.  He forgave her, married her and Dil-aram, and lived happily with his four wives."

Her father set goldsmiths to make it, but none of them matched her dream. Then she saw a white bear in the woods and it had the wreath. The bear would not give it to her before she agreed to go away with him, and got three days to prepare for the trip. The daughter did not care for anything as long as she had the wreath, and her father was glad of her happiness and thought he could keep off the bear, but when it arrived, it attacked the king's army and defeated them, unscathed.

The king sent out his oldest daughter. The bear took her on its back and rushed off with her, but asked her if she had ever sat softer or seen clearer, and she said she had, on her mother's lap, and at her father's court; so the white bear brought her back to the castle.
The next Thursday it came again, and the king tried his second daughter, and she also failed. The third Thursday, the king had sent his third daughter, and she had never sat softer or seen clearer, so it took her to its castle. Every night, it turned into a man and came to her bed in the dark.
Every year, the princess had a child, but as soon as the baby was born, the bear rushed away with it. At the end of three years, she asked to visit her parents. There, her mother gave her a candle so that she could see him. At night, she lit it and looked at him, and a drop of tallow fell on his forehead, waking him. He told her that if she had waited another month, he would have been free of an evil witch queen's spell, but now he must go to the witch's realm and become her husband. He rushed off, but she seized his fur and rode him, though the branches battered her, until she was so tired that she fell off.

The princess searched in a forest until she came to a cottage where an old woman and a little girl were. The old woman told her that the bear had gone by; the little girl had a scissors that, whenever she cut in the air, silk and velvet appeared, but she said the woman had more need of it, and gave it to her. She went on to another hut, with another old woman and little girl. This time, the little girl gave her a flask that poured whatever was wished for and never emptied. She went on to a third hut, where the little girl gave her a cloth that could conjure up food. The fourth night, the princess came to a hut where an old woman had many children who cried for food and had no clothing. The princess fed and clothed them, so the old woman had her husband, a smith, make her iron claws so she could climb the mountainside to the witch's country.
The princess reached the witch's castle. She started to clip out cloth. The witch offered to trade for them; the princess insisted on a night with her sweetheart, but the witch agreed but drugged him with a sleeping potion, so that she could not wake him. The next day, she bribed her way in with the flask; again the witch had put him to sleep, but an artisan next door heard her and told the king. The third day, she bribed her way in with the cloth, and the king had not drunk the drink, and they could talk. They come up with an idea how to kill the witch.

And so the day arrived when the king was to marry the witch, and witches from various lands came there for this occasion. But the king had carpenters put a hidden trapdoor in a bridge over a deep chasm where the wedding procession would ride, and so the witch-bride fell through it along with all of her bridesmaids. With the forces of evil destroyed, and the curse broken, the king and the princess took the treasures from the witch's castle and then went to his homeland for the real wedding. On the way, they took the little girls, and the princess learned that they were her own daughters, whom the king had taken so they could aid her in her quest."
yasmin_and_the_serpent_prince,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasmin_and_the_Serpent_Prince_(Iranian_folktale),Yasmin and the Serpent Prince,Yasmin and the Serpent Prince is a Persian folktale published in 1974 by author Forough Hekmat. It is related to the international cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom or The Search for the Lost Husband.,"Long time ago, in a Persian city, a merchant named Hajji Muhammad lives with his five daughters, the youngest, named Yasmin, the one he loves best of all. One day, he has to go on a journey, and asks his daughters what they want as gifts. The four elders want extravagant garments and shoes, but the youngest asks for a clustered bunch of grape-like pearls and a starred, two-pointed diamond.
Hajji Muhammad goes on his journey and, after doing his business, buys the presents for his four elder daughters, but has trouble finding Yasmin's request. His quest is interrupted by a violent storm, so he takes shelter in a castle in the middle of a plain. He enters the castle and notices that the garden is full of silver and gold trees.
This mysterious garden seems like a vision of paradise: flowers made of precious gems, stream of milk and honey flowing from the trees, and many melodies coming from the trees. He ventures deep into the garden and finds the branch of pearls and diamonds. He goes to pluck it, but a roar behind him interrupts his action. The merchant turns around and sees a large snake, of a bright green colour.
The merchant explains to the green snake that the branch is supposed to be a present for his youngest daughter, Yasmin. Noticing that the merchant seems too interested in the branch from his garden, the green snake makes a deal with him: he shall get the branch, but, in return, his youngest daughter is to be given to the serpent as his wife. The merchant is a bit alarmed by the proposal about his daughter, about any potential danger. The snake assuages his fears and they seal a written pact.
The merchant returns home with the branch, jewels and presents for his daughters. Time passes, and he forgets about his promise to the snake, until one day, a knock is heard at the door. It is the snake, come to take his wife, as promised. The merchant goes inside to tell Yasmin about his promise. Yasmin agrees that promises must be kept, but, hoping to delay - and even discourage - the snake about the marriage proposal, she says the snake must prepare a feast for 40 days, where the finest dishes and drinks are to be served, and every guest must be showered with gems.
The animal agrees with the conditions and takes a three day leave for wedding preparations. The snake returns after three days on a golden coach and takes them to the wedding feast, in the same garden where Hajji Muhammad found the pearl-and-diamond branch. Yasmin, the bride, stays silent all the time.
After the feast ends and the guests rest, the snake and Yasmin retire to a spacious apartment. Yasmin, then, breaks her silence and asks the snake about his true identity, since it cannot be a mere animal, due to his magical powers. The serpent makes her promise not to tell his secret, and, casting a spell on himself, sheds its snakeskin. He reveals that he is Prince Baharam, son of the Shah of Demons, who has come from the World of Darkness to the world of man, interested in the good qualities of human people (justice, learning, love for one another), in contrast to the wickedness and base interests of the demons.
They live as husband and wife for two years, him a snake by day and a prince by night. However, she begins to miss home, and longs to show that her husband is truly human. One day, she asks Baharam about how to destroy his snakeskin. She insists to know and he tells that the skin needs to be burned with shells of pistachio nut. She delights at the answer, but feels torn between keeping his secret and destroying the snakeskin.
Some time later, she decides to visit her family, and her husband warns her not to reveal his secret. Her sisters inquire her about her life in the snake's castle, and a gossiping aunt begins to pry more and more into her life, so much so that she reveals the snake is human underneath. Her aunt suggests she burns the snakeskin, so that he remains human at all times, and gives her some pistachio nuts.
Yasmin goes home to her husband. While Baharam is asleep, she leaves the bed, gets the snakeskin from a chest, and takes it to kitchen to burn it with the shells of pistachio nuts. The next morning, Baharam awakes and asks his wife about the snakeskin. Yasmin answers that she burned it. He despairs at the fact and tells that he needed his scaly disguise, but now he has to return to the Realm of Darkness, back to his people. Yasmin throws herself at his feet and begs for forgiveness. He chastises her, and says that, to find him again, she has to walk towards the West, for 7 years, in 7 iron suits, 7 iron shoes, and with 7 iron canes. Baharam goes to the garden, chants a spell and vanishes, the castle and everything along with him, leaving Yasmin lost in a desert. 
Despite the hunger and thirst, Yasmin traverses the desert back to her father's house. He welcomes her and lets her grieve for her lost husband.  After six months, she decides to begin her arduous quest toward the Realm of Darkness. Her father commissions the iron garments and the iron canes, and she sets out. For seven years, she walks and walks, wanders high and low, until the seventh iron dress and the seventh iron shoes are worn, and the seventh iron cane is nothing but a stump in her hands. Tired of the long journey, and not knowing if she has arrived, she lies down to sleep.
After a whole day and night, she wakes up and notices she is in a meadow, full of animals of a black colour. Even the trees and flowers are black, and light does not seem to reach that land. She asks a passing man with black horns on his head whose meadow it is. The horned man says it belongs to Prince Baharam, the son of the Shah of Demons. She goes to drink a bit of the black water, and sees a slave-girl coming to get water.
The slave-girl says she is fetching water for her master, the prince. Yasmin sees a nearby castle made of black stone, and has an idea: she asks for the slave-girl to drink a bit of the water, and drops her wedding ring in it. Inside the castle, the slave-girl drops the water on Prince Baharam's hands and the ring falls out of the jug. He recognizes it and asks the slave-girl if anyone was outside. She says a woman is resting by a tree when she left to fetch water. Baharam goes outside and finds his wife Yasmin. They embrace, after seven long years, and rejoice in each other's presence. Baharam warns her of the danger the demons pose, and suggests he changes her appearance to keep her safe, until they find a chance to escape.
Baharam turns her into a golden needle and brings her home with him to the castle. Despite the magic disguise, the prince's stepmother smells a ""Child of Adam"" (a human) in their castle. Afraid of being found out, Baharam changes the needle into a broom, then into a piece of wood, and lastly into a spray of flowers to throw her off the human's scent, but to no avail. He then decides to introduce Yasmin to his stepmother, the Queen of Demons, as a weary traveller from the world of man. The queen of demons begrudgingly accepts her as a guest.
The next day, the Queen of Demons gives two pieces of cloth to Yasmin, and orders her to wash the white one black and the black one into white. Baharam chants a spell to change the colours. The next task is for her to fill seven clays jars with a sieve - her husband casts a spell on the sieve to fill the holes. The third task is for her to separate a heap of mixed seeds (wheat, rice, lentils, millet, poppy and vetch) - Baharam summons a swarm of ants to separate the grains.
The last task is for Yasmin to go to the stepmother's sister and get from her the ""Give-and-Take-Box"". Baharam advises her to compliment a thorny branch by saying it is a rosebush; to compliment a dirty river by saying it is rosewater; to give the animals their correct fodder (straw for the donkeys, bones to the dogs), open all closed doors and shut all open ones in his step-aunt's house, get the box and do not open it, and escape.   Yasmin follows the instructions to the letter, gets a little black box from the step-aunt, and hurries back to the castle of the Queen of Demons. The step-aunt commands the doors, the dogs, the donkeys, the river and the thorns to stop her, but, due to her kind actions, she leaves unscathed.
Now at a safe distance, she tries to peer into the box. The lid opens up and a swarm of flies escape from it. Baharam appears to her, casts a spell and the flies go back to the box. On their journey back to the castle, Baharam tells her that his stepmother planned his wedding to his cousin, and the castle will be swarmed with demons that will kill Yasmin, so they must hurry and escape that night. He then asks her to get them a bag of needles, a box of salt and a jar of water.
That night, the demons are coming to the castle to Baharam's wedding. At midnight, Baharam excuses himself and goes to see Yasmin. They sneak out to the stables and ride his horse away from the castle. The next morning, the Queen of Demons discovers the pair's flight and command an army of giants to go after them.
Baharam and Yasmin are riding on the prince's black horse and hear the approach of the giants. Yasmin throws the bag of needles behind them, which turn into a forest of thorns to deter the giants. Next, they throw the box of salt, turning the desert into a sea of salt. Lastle, they pour out the contents of the water jug, and a vast sea appears between them and the coming giants. The pursuers try to cross the sea to get them, but sink and drown in it. 
Now safe at last, the prince and Yasmin ride to the city where her father  trades as a merchant, and spend the rest of their lives in happiness."
ye_xian,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_Xian,Ye Xian,"""Ye Xian"" (simplified Chinese: 叶限; traditional Chinese: 葉限; pinyin: Yè Xiàn; Wade–Giles: Yeh Hsien; [jê ɕjɛ̂n]) is a Chinese fairy tale that is similar to the European Cinderella story, the Malay-Indonesian Bawang Putih Bawang Merah tale, the Vietnamese Tấm Cám story, and stories from other ethnic groups including the Tibetans and the Zhuangs.  It is one of the oldest known variants of Cinderella, first published in the Tang dynasty compilation Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written around 850 by Duan Chengshi. Chinese compilations attest several versions from oral sources.

","Long before the Qin  and Han Dynasty, in a small community of cave-dwellers called Wudong, their chief by the name of Wu had two wives by custom and a daughter by each of them. Ye Xian is Wu's daughter of one wife, and she is extremely beautiful, kind and gentle, and gifted in many skills such as pottery and poetry. In contrast, her half-sister Jun-Li is plain-looking, cruel and selfish, and both she and her mother, Wu's other wife Jin, envy the attention Wu lavishes upon Ye Xian. Ye Xian's mother died while she was still a baby, so Wu did all he could to raise his motherless daughter.
Unfortunately, Ye Xian's father dies from a local plague, and a new chieftain is appointed to take his place, as Wu had no sons. With her family reduced to poverty, Ye Xian is forced to become a lowly servant and work for her unloving and cruel stepmother, Jin, and spoiled and lazy younger half-sister Jun-Li.  Despite living a life burdened with chores and housework, and suffering endless abuse at her stepmother's hands, she finds solace when she ends up befriending a beautiful, 10 foot (3.0 m) fish in the lake near her home, with golden eyes and scales. The fish was really a guardian spirit sent to her by her own mother, who never forgot her daughter even beyond the grave.
One day, Jun-Li follows Ye Xian to the lake, and discovers her talking to the fish. Angry that Ye Xian has found happiness, she told her mother everything that she had seen. The cruel woman tricks Ye Xian into giving her the tattered dress she wears, and by this, catches and kills the fish and serves it for dinner for herself and Jun-Li.  Ye Xian is devastated until the spirit of an old man, possibly one of her ancestors or her maternal grandfather, in a white robe with white hair, appears and tells her to bury the bones of the fish in four pots and hide each pot at the corners under her bed. The spirit also tells her that whatever she needs will be granted if she talks to the bones.
Once a year, the New Year Festival is to be celebrated; this is also the time for young maidens to meet potential husbands.  Not wishing to spoil her own daughter's chances, the stepmother forces her stepdaughter to remain home and clean their cave-house.  After her step-family has left for the festival, Ye Xian is visited by the fish's spirit again. She makes a silent wish to the bones and Ye Xian finds herself clothed magnificently, in a gown of sea-green silk, a cloak of kingfisher feathers and a pair of tiny golden slippers.
Ye Xian goes to the festival by foot. She is admired by everyone, in particular the young men who believed her to be a princess, and enjoys herself until she hears Jun-Li call out to the crowd, ""That girl looks like my older sister!"" Realizing that her family might have recognized her, Ye Xian leaves, accidentally leaving behind a golden slipper.  When she arrives home, she hides her finery and the remaining slipper under her bed. The fish bones are silent now, however, for they warned Ye Xian before not to lose even one of her slippers. Sadly, she falls asleep under a tree. Her step family return from the festival and mention a mysterious beauty who appeared at the festival, but are unaware that it is Ye Xian they are speaking of.
The golden slipper is found by a local peasant who trades it, and it is passed on to various people until it reaches the hands of the nearby king of the To'Han islets, a powerful kingdom covering thousands of small islands. Fascinated by the shoe's small size, he issues a search to find the maiden whose foot will fit into the shoe and proclaims he will marry that girl. The search extends until it reaches the community of the cave-dwellers, and every maiden, even Jun-Li, tries on the slipper: but no one's foot can fit the shoe. Despondent that he cannot find the woman he was searching for, the king makes a great pavilion and places the shoe there on display. Ye Xian arrives there late in the evening to retrieve the slipper, but is mistaken as a thief. Ye Xian is then brought before the king, and there she tells him everything about her life, how she lost her friend, the gold-eyed fish, and now her slipper. The king, struck by her good-nature and beauty even though she lives in the land of the savages, believes her and allows her to go home with the slipper.
The next morning, the king goes into Ye Xian's house and asks her to come with him into his kingdom. Ye Xian then wears both her shoes, and appears in her beautiful sea-green gown. The stepmother and Jun-Li, however, insist that Ye Xian could not have clothes of that kind, for she is only their slave. The stepmother says that the finery is Jun-Li's, and that Ye Xian stole them. The king dismisses her lies, and invites Ye Xian to marry him and live in his palace. She accepts, but her cruel step-family is left with the worst possible fate: each other. The stepmother forces Jun-Li, who has lost all hope of marrying rich, into the same state of servitude that Ye Xian suffered for so many years. When Jun-Li promptly and bitterly rebels against her lot, it starts a violent quarrel, the result of which is a cave-in that buries both women and destroys their home. Meanwhile, the king takes Ye Xian's hand in marriage and makes her his queen."

","A king and a queen lived the misfortune of not having children. They had enlisted the help of healers, magicians, and philosophers, but no one could drive away their unhappiness. After a while, they find an uncle who gives them useful cures, warning them that they will have only one son, named Făt-Frumos, but that they will not have him. However, the empress takes the medicine and in a few days her time to give birth comes, but the child, still unborn, begins to cry. The king promises the son empires and an emperor's daughter as a future wife, but in vain. In the end, the emperor promises the child eternal youth and immortality. Then the baby is silent and born. But when he reaches the age of 15, the prince reminds his father to keep his word.
As the emperor cannot fulfill his wish, the prince decides to go out into the world to find eternal youth and immortality. He chooses a horse from the stable, knowing that among them was an enchanted one. On his advice, he prepares thoroughly: he feeds the horse for six weeks with milk-boiled barley, finds his grandfather's clothes and weapons from his youth, and only then does he set out in search of his ideal. The prince's journey begins in the wilderness and is a road to the east, which the hero must travel alone.
The first obstacle she has to pass is the estate of Gheonoaia, a being cursed by her parents, whom the prince defeats and asks her for a document with her blood in order to sanctify the peace. Gheonoaia has three girls like fairies and asks the prince to choose one as his bride, but the hero, having an ideal that he does not want to abandon, he goes on, reaching the estate of Scorpia, Gheonoaia's sister, whom he also defeats. The third test means confronting the wildest beasts in the world, who day and night guard the palace of eternal youth. Helped by one of the fairies who live in the palace, he overcomes this obstacle and fulfills his wish. The much sought after eternal youth is represented by the three fairies, who receive him with joy, and the prince marries one of them. Here life takes place in peace and delight, but there is a dangerous place: the Valley of Lamentation. The one who gets there is homesick. Coincidentally, on a hunting day, the prince enters this space and, overwhelmed by memories, sets off for his parents' house. Centuries have passed in the world left by the hero, cities have risen, and the hero is suddenly aging. Before parting with his guiding horse, the prince makes a surprising promise: ""Go healthy, for I hope to return soon.""
The prince finds Death crouched waiting in a little box, in the cellar of his parents' castle, now in ruins, and leaves himself reaped as his weak knees are trembling with fear."
